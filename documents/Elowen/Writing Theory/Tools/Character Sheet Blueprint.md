# Character Sheet Blueprint

Okay, here is an improved and significantly more exhaustive Character Blueprint, integrating the core concepts from Sanderson, McKee, Cron, Truby, and Zuckerman, and explicitly incorporating the psychological principles derived from the research analysis. This aims to be a robust tool for creating characters that are not only functional but deeply resonant.

**The Resonant Character Blueprint: [Character Name]**

**PART 1: NARRATIVE FUNCTION & PSYCHOLOGICAL HOOK**

- **1. Core Narrative Role & Purpose:**
    - **Function:** ( ) Protagonist ( ) Antagonist ( ) Major Supporting ( ) Minor Supporting ( ) Foil ( ) Mentor ( ) Catalyst ( ) Other: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
    - **Narrative Contribution:** (How do they specifically serve the Plot, Theme, or other Characters? e.g., "Drives main plot via desire for X," "Embodies thematic counter-argument Y," "Challenges protagonist's core misbelief Z," "Provides essential exposition/skill")
    - **Structural Significance:** (Do they initiate key plot points, represent a major turning point, embody the core conflict?)
- **2. Initial Archetype & Reader Schema:**
    - **Archetype/Trope:** (The initial "box" or schema the reader might use – e.g., "Noble Savage," "Femme Fatale," "Reluctant Hero," "Mad Scientist," "Wise Old Mentor") \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
    - **Plan for Depth/Subversion:** (How will you move beyond this initial schema? Introduce contradictions? Reveal hidden depths? Subvert expectations?)
    - *Psychological Check:* Leveraging familiar schemas provides cognitive ease initially, while later subversion creates intrigue and forces reappraisal.
- **3. Reader Engagement Strategy (Psychological Goals):**
    - **Desired Initial Reader Reaction:** (What feeling should the hook/first impression evoke? Intrigue, Empathy, Dislike, Curiosity, Amusement, Admiration?)
    - **Primary Mode of Connection:** (What psychological pathway will be the main hook?)
        - [ ]  **Empathy/Identification:** (Feeling *with*/*as* them due to shared humanity/vulnerability)
        - [ ]  **Admiration/Aspiration:** (Engaging via competence, proactivity, moral strength)
        - [ ]  **Curiosity/Intellectual Engagement:** (Intrigue via mystery, unique worldview, complex motivations)
        - [ ]  **Antagonistic Fascination:** (Love-to-hate via compelling opposition, complex villainy)
    - **Desired Emotional Journey for Reader:** (What sequence of feelings do you want the reader to experience *in relation to this character*? e.g., Initial pity -> growing admiration -> worry -> cathartic relief; Intrigue -> suspicion -> shock -> complex understanding).
    - **Desired Final Reader Feeling Towards Character:** (e.g., Triumph, Tragedy, Bittersweet Acceptance, Respect, Contempt, Ambivalence). *Align this with the intended story meaning/theme.*

**PART 2: THE INTERNAL LANDSCAPE – CORE PSYCHOLOGY**

- **4. Core Motivation & Driving Goal (The Engine - McKee/Cron/Truby/Zuckerman/Sanderson):**
    - **Primary External WANT (The Plot Goal):** (Specific, tangible objective – e.g., "Avenge father's death," "Win the tournament," "Find the lost city," "Secure love interest")
    - **Primary Internal NEED (The Psychological/Moral Goal):** (Often subconscious, related to overcoming the core flaw/misbelief – e.g., "Need for self-worth," "Need to trust," "Need for connection," "Need for redemption," "Need to accept reality")
    - **The "Why" Behind the Want:** (What deep-seated drive, past experience, or belief fuels the external Want? How does it *promise* to fulfill the Need, even if misguidedly?)
    - **Stakes & Risk:** What are they willing to risk/sacrifice for this Desire? (McKee: This defines the value of the desire). How high are the personal, relational, and external stakes?
    - **Conflicting Motivations:** (Internal contradictions creating tension – e.g., Desire for justice vs. Desire for peace; Need for safety vs. Need for excitement). *Psychological Check:* Reflects realistic psychological ambivalence.
- **5. Core Internal Obstacle: Misbelief / Flaw / Weakness (The Brakes - Cron/Truby/Sanderson/Zuckerman):**
    - **The Defining Misbelief/Flaw:** (The central faulty assumption about self/world that hinders the Need/Want – e.g., "I am unworthy of love," "The world is inherently hostile," "Power is the only safety," "Vulnerability is fatal," "I must control everything")
    - **Origin Story (The Ghost):** (What specific past event(s) or formative experiences created this Misbelief/Flaw? Be specific.) (Cron/Truby) *Psychological Check:* Grounding flaws in believable backstory increases authenticity and empathy.
    - **Manifestation:** How does this Misbelief/Flaw actively *prevent* the character from achieving their true Need or sabotage their pursuit of the Want? How does it shape their worldview and reactions?
- **6. True Character vs. Characterization (The Core vs. The Mask - McKee/Cron):**
    - **Characterization (Surface):** (Observable traits – appearance, mannerisms, speech style, stated attitudes, social role). How do they *present* themselves?
    - **True Character (Depth):** (Core values revealed under pressure – Honest/Dishonest, Loyal/Disloyal, Brave/Cowardly, Selfless/Selfish). What choices will they make when the stakes are highest, potentially contradicting their surface characterization?
    - **Internal Contradictions:** Identify key contradictions *within* True Character or *between* Characterization and True Character. These are sources of depth and surprise.
- **7. Values & Moral Compass (The Limits - McKee/Truby/Sanderson):**
    - **Core Values:** (What principles do they consciously or unconsciously live by? e.g., Family First, Honor Above All, Survival at Any Cost, Pursuit of Knowledge).
    - **Moral Boundaries:** (What lines will they absolutely *not* cross, even for their Desire? What constitutes their personal "evil"?)
    - **Sacrifice Calculus:** (What *are* they willing to sacrifice? Where does their Desire rank against their other values?)
    - **Potential for Moral Shift:** How might events challenge these values and boundaries? Is a shift (positive or negative) part of their arc?

**PART 3: EXTERNAL PRESENTATION & INTERACTION**

- **8. Proactivity Level & Style (Sanderson):**
    - **Initial Level:** (High/Medium/Low) Does this change?
    - **Style of Action:** (How do they pursue goals? Direct confrontation, manipulation, careful planning, impulsive action, seeking help, avoidance?)
    - **Triggers:** What situations make them *more* or *less* proactive?
- **9. Capability Level & Domains (Sanderson):**
    - **Initial Level:** (High/Medium/Low overall, but specify domains)
    - **Key Competencies:** (List specific skills, talents, knowledge – physical, mental, social, magical, unique gifts like loyalty/intuition). How were these acquired?
    - **Key INCOMPETENCIES/Limitations:** (Crucial areas where they lack skill, knowledge, or inherent ability. These often create conflict and necessitate reliance on others or force growth). Connect these to Sanderson's 2nd Law – how do limitations make the story *more* interesting?
    - **Demonstration:** How will competence and incompetence be *shown* in action?
- **10. Personality & Expression (The Surface - Zuckerman/Sanderson):**
    - **Dominant Traits:** (How do they generally come across? Introvert/Extrovert, Optimist/Pessimist, Serious/Humorous, Aggressive/Passive, etc.)
    - **Voice (Dialogue & Internal Monologue):**
        - *Vocabulary & Syntax:* (Simple/Complex, Formal/Informal, Slang/Jargon)
        - *Rhythm & Cadence:* (Fast/Slow, Hesitant/Fluent, Use of pauses/interjections)
        - *Figurative Language:* (Use of metaphors, sarcasm, irony, humor style?)
        - *Verbal Tics/Catchphrases:* (Use sparingly for distinctiveness)
    - **Non-Verbal Communication:** (Posture, gestures, facial expressions, eye contact – how do these reveal internal states or personality?)
    - **Defining Quirks:** (Unique habits, interests, minor obsessions. *Link to deeper motivations/flaws for maximum impact*).
    - **Visual Signifier (Optional):** (A memorable physical detail aiding reader recall).

**PART 4: THE ARC OF CHANGE (OR STASIS)**

- **11. Character Arc Type:**
    - [ ]  **Growth Arc:** Positive change, overcoming Flaw/Misbelief, fulfilling Need.
    - [ ]  **Fall Arc:** Tragic decline, succumbing to Flaw, failing Need, possibly becoming antagonistic.
    - [ ]  **Shift Arc:** Change in understanding, role, or worldview without clear positive/negative moral judgment.
    - [ ]  **Flat/Iconic Arc:** Character remains fundamentally unchanged internally but impacts the world around them; tests their existing capabilities/values against external challenges.
- **12. Starting Point (Snapshot):** Summarize their state regarding Motivation, Flaw/Misbelief, True Character, Values, Proactivity, Capability, and Relatability at the beginning.
- **13. The Journey – Key Structural Turning Points & Internal Shifts:**
    - **Inciting Incident Reaction:** How does the initial disruption interact with their Flaw/Desire?
    - **First Plot Point (~25%):** What choice/event locks them into the main conflict? How does it force a preliminary confrontation with their internal struggle?
    - **Midpoint Shift (~50%):** Moment of revelation or significant change in approach (often Reactive -> Proactive). How does this alter their understanding or commitment?
    - **Third Plot Point / Crisis (~75%):** Lowest point, maximum pressure. How does this force the ultimate confrontation with their Flaw/Misbelief? What is the core **Crisis Choice** (McKee/Truby)?
    - **Climax (Action & Internal Resolution):** How does their action in the climax reflect their internal change (or lack thereof)? Does it include the "Aha! Moment" (Cron) or Self-Revelation (Truby)?
    - **Try/Fail Cycles & Key Obstacles:** List specific challenges designed to test their Flaw/Misbelief and force incremental growth or reveal stagnation. How do failures inform future attempts? (Sanderson/Truby)
- **14. End Point / New Equilibrium (Snapshot):** Summarize their state at the end. How have they changed (or solidified)? Is the Need met? Is the Misbelief corrected? What is their new understanding or status?

**PART 5: INTEGRATION WITH STORY WORLD & NARRATIVE**

- **15. Key Relationships & Character Web (Truby):**
    - Map out key relationships (Ally, Opponent, Fake-Ally, Mentor, Foil, Love Interest).
    - How does each relationship *define* this character through comparison/contrast?
    - How do these relationships impact their arc (support, challenge, betray)?
- **16. Plot & Thematic Function:**
    - How does this character's **Desire** and **Actions** drive the external plot (Big P Plot - Sanderson)?
    - How does their **Internal Arc** (Need, Flaw, Transformation) illuminate the story's central **Theme** or **Moral Argument** (McKee/Truby)? Do they embody the theme, challenge it, or demonstrate its consequences?
- **17. Setting & World Interaction:**
    - How does the specific **Story World** (Physical, Cultural, Magical - Sanderson) impose **Limitations** or offer **Opportunities** relevant to this character's goals and flaws?
    - How does the character's **Worldview** (Cron) shape their perception of and interaction *with* the setting?
    - Do they **Embody** or **Challenge** norms/aspects of their world?
- **18. Narrative Presentation Strategy:**
    - **Viewpoint Access:** POV Character Non-POV
    - **If POV:** Type (1st Intimate/Narrator; 3rd Limited/Omni/Storyteller) & Tense (Past/Present). Why this choice? What unique perspective/information do they offer? *Psychological Check:* How does this choice impact reader immersion, identification, and access to internal states?
    - **If Non-POV:** How is their internal state revealed (Actions, Dialogue, Subtext, Other Characters' Perceptions)? How is reader connection maintained?
    - **Reliability:** Reliable Unreliable. If unreliable, how is this signaled subtly or overtly? What is the narrative purpose of the unreliability?
- **19. Core Promises & Payoffs (Sanderson):**
    - **Promises Made:** What expectations does the character's introduction and early journey create for the reader regarding their arc, capabilities, role, or the story's tone/genre?
    - **Intended Payoffs:** How will these promises be fulfilled, subverted, or resolved? What is the intended emotional/intellectual payoff associated with this character's journey conclusion (e.g., Stand-up-and-cheer, tragic insight, satisfying twist)?

**Part 6: Refinement & Resonance Check**

- **Authenticity Check:** Does this character feel psychologically plausible, even within a fantastical setting? Do their motivations, flaws, and choices align coherently (drawing on McKee's self-knowledge principle)?
- **Interest Factor:** Does the combination of Proactivity, Relatability, and Capability create an engaging balance? Are the limitations and contradictions compelling (Sanderson's 2nd Law)?
- **Clarity & Memorability:** Is the character distinct? Are their core motivations and personality clear to the reader through presentation?
- **Integration Check:** Does the character feel organically connected to the plot, theme, setting, and other characters, or do they feel isolated or forced?
- **Potential Pitfalls:** Revisit common issues – lack of clear motivation, inconsistent behavior, insufficient flaws/stakes, info-dumping through dialogue, the "Michael problem" (overly repetitive single motivation), unbelievable capabilities, unresolved/unearned arc.

**How to Use This Improved Blueprint:**

1. **Deep Dive:** Use this as a comprehensive checklist during character creation *and* revision. Force yourself to articulate the "why" behind choices.
2. **Prioritize the Core:** Start with Motivation, Need, Flaw/Misbelief, and True Character (Part 2) as these often form the internal engine.
3. **Link Internal to External:** Constantly connect the internal landscape (Part 2) to external presentation (Part 3) and plot function (Part 4 & 5). How does the internal state *manifest*? How does the plot *challenge* it?
4. **Think Psychologically:** Use the embedded psychological checks to consider *how* your choices will likely impact the reader's engagement, empathy, and understanding.
5. **Iterate:** This is a tool for exploration. Fill it out, write scenes, discover new things, and come back to update and refine the blueprint. It’s a living document for your character.
6. **Scale:** Apply the relevant depth based on the character's importance. Not every character needs every section filled exhaustively.
