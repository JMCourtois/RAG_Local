# Brandon Sandersonâ€™s Lectures 2025

# Lecture 1 - The Philosophy of Professional Writing

**I. Class Structure & Philosophy**

- **Format:** A lecture series ("fire hose of information") recorded for later viewing, supplemented by Q&A sessions. Assumes students aim towards professional writing for teaching purposes.
- **Core Topics:** Two weeks each on Plot, Setting, Character, and the Business of Writing, plus guest lectures (often on short stories or indie publishing) and dedicated Q&A weeks. Mini-lectures on Revision and Prose may be included.
- **Learning Philosophy:**
    - **Writing is Learned by Doing:** You will learn more by writing your first book than any class can teach you. Writing requires exploration, practice, and revision.
    - **Advice is Subjective:** Not all advice (even from Sanderson) will work for every writer or every project. Different writers have different processes (*Orson Scott Card vs. Stephen King* on outlining).
    - **Goal: Be a Chef, Not a Cook:** Understand the *principles* behind writing techniques (like a chef understands ingredients and heat) rather than just following rigid rules/recipes (like a cook). This allows for adaptation, problem-solving, and creating unique work.
- **Professional vs. Hobbyist:**
    - **All Valid:** Writing for personal enrichment, as a hobby, or as a career are all valid reasons to learn. Art's primary purpose is often enriching the artist's life.
    - **Societal Pressure:** Be aware that society often asks utilitarian questions ("Are you published?") about writing, unlike other hobbies (e.g., basketball). Don't let this dictate your reasons for writing.
    - **Class Assumption:** For teaching efficiency, the class assumes a professional aspiration (aiming for a full-time living within ~10 years) because that advice encompasses the tools needed for other writing goals (better GMing, journaling, hobby writing).

**II. The Reality of a Writing Career**

- **Difficulty:** Making a full-time living solely from fiction writing is statistically difficult, comparable to careers in professional music or fine art. It's achievable but requires significant dedication and likely some luck.
- **Odds:** Better than "one in a million," perhaps closer to "one in 20" *for those who persist seriously for ~10 years*, but still challenging. Many successful authors contribute *part* of their income, not all.
- **Necessity of Practice:** The early years are crucial for developing process and craft *before* facing professional pressures (deadlines, public critique, sales stress). Finishing multiple novels is key to building this foundation.
- **"First Five Books" Concept:** A helpful mindset (though not a strict rule) is to view early novels as practice ("learning your scales"). This alleviates pressure to make the first book perfect and encourages continued writing and learning. Sold my 6th, Dan sold his 6th, Rachel sold her 7th. *Mistborn* was Sanderson's 14th written novel.
- **The "Ugly Baby" Problem:** New writers often struggle when their execution doesn't match their brilliant initial vision. Recognize this is normal; skill develops over time. *Push through and keep writing.*
- **Product of Writing Time:** Focus on the process. *You* are the artwork being shaped by the act of writing. It improves empathy, expression, and skill. The sellable books are a byproduct of this growth.
- **Artist vs. Business Person:**
    - *During Writing:* Let the artist be in charge, making decisions based on story and character integrity.
    - *After Finishing:* Let the "business person" side take over to figure out how to market and sell the completed work, without compromising the original artistic vision during revisions prompted *solely* by market concerns. (Though initial project choice *can* be influenced by market awareness - *John Scalzi* example).

**III. Discovery Writing vs. Outlining ("Gardener vs. Architect")**

- **Spectrum, Not Dichotomy:** Most writers fall somewhere between pure discovery ("pantsing," George R.R. Martin's "gardener") and detailed outlining ("architect").
- **Finding Your Process:** Requires experimentation. Try both approaches to see what works best for you and for specific projects. Your process will likely evolve over your career.
- **Common Pitfalls:**
    - *Discovery Writers:* Risk over-revising early chapters and never finishing ("80 first chapters"). Need discipline to move forward.
    - *Outliners:* Risk losing excitement ("already told the story") or neglecting necessary revision after the first draft. Need discipline to revisit and refine.

**IV. Motivation & Persistence**

- **Find Your Joy:** Identify the aspects of writing you genuinely enjoy (worldbuilding, character interaction, the flow state). This intrinsic motivation is crucial.
- **Track Progress:** Use tools like spreadsheets to log daily word counts against a reasonable goal (e.g., 1000 words/day). Creates a sense of accomplishment and consistent progress, countering feelings of being overwhelmed. Works like leveling up in a game.
- **Bundle Habits:** Pair writing/revision (especially disliked parts like revision) with existing positive habits (e.g., revise for 30 mins at the coffee shop you visit daily).
- **Define Success:** Redefine success internally, especially early on. Focus on controllable goals (finishing drafts, consistent practice) rather than external validation (publishing). (*Sanderson's decision: "If I'm 90 and never sell a book... I'm a success."*)
- **Survivorship Bias:** Be critical of advice from successful authors (including Sanderson). Success involves luck and timing; what worked for one person isn't a guaranteed formula. Focus on building *your* skills and process using various tools.

**V. Revision**

- **Essential Skill:** Learning to revise effectively is as crucial as learning to draft, and often harder.
- **Common Avoidance:** Many writers (especially outliners) dislike revision and avoid it, hindering their progress.
- **Learn Through Practice:** Like drafting, revision skill comes from doing it. Revise early (maybe not great) books to learn the process.
- **Revision Guide (Outliner Technique):** Treat revision like debugging code. Get feedback, create a prioritized list of issues ("bugs"), and tackle them systematically in a dedicated revision draft. Provides structure and a sense of accomplishment.

**VI. Writing Groups**

- **Potential Benefits:** Can provide valuable feedback, motivation, networking, and a sense of community. Success can breed success (*Sanderson's, Tolkien/Lewis groups*).
- **Potential Dangers:** Can ruin books if feedback isn't handled well, especially for discovery writers susceptible to having their vision hijacked. Bad advice or overly prescriptive critiques can stifle creativity.
- **Guidelines for Success:**
    - **For Discovery Writers:** Be cautious about submitting work *before* a first draft is complete. Protect your initial creative spark.
    - **Receiving Feedback:** *Listen* and take notes. Avoid defending or over-explaining, as this biases the feedback. Let the feedback sit before deciding what to use (often only ~1/3 is truly helpful). Consider getting feedback on a *finished* draft while working on something new.
    - **Giving Feedback:** Be *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*. Explain your *reaction* as a reader ("I was confused here," "I felt disconnected here," "This part was exciting") rather than telling the author *how* to fix it. Your job is to reflect the reader experience, not rewrite their book.
- **Not for Everyone:** Writing groups are a tool, not a requirement. Try them, but if they don't work for your process, find other ways to get feedback (beta readers, trusted individuals).

# Lecture 2 - Plot Theory: Promise, Progress, Payoff

**I. Foundational Concepts**

- **The Core Components of Story:** Stories are generally built from three interconnected elements:
    - **Plot:** The sequence of events.
    - **Setting:** The world and environment.
    - **Character:** The individuals experiencing the story.
- **Conflict as the Intersection:** The intersection of Plot, Setting, and Character creates **Conflict**. All three elements should exist to facilitate or create conflict, as conflict is the essence of story.
- **The Purpose of Plot:**
    1. **Facilitate Conflict:** The primary mechanism for introducing challenges and obstacles that characters must confront. (A thing needs to happen, characters must do it, something is in the way).
    2. **Provide Structure:** Gives the reader a framework to follow, a sense of movement, and assurance that a story is being told.
- **Plot and Innovation:**
    - Plot is generally the *most difficult* element (compared to Setting and Character) to innovate upon successfully.
    - Readers have ingrained expectations for satisfying story structures (often stemming from Western storytelling traditions, though cultural variations exist, especially in Payoff).
    - Subverting expectations often leads to unsatisfying stories, unless done intentionally and skillfully.
    - Focusing on unique characters and settings combined with solid plotting principles is usually more effective than trying to reinvent plot structure itself (e.g., *Dune*, *The Lion King*, *Hamlet* share structures but feel distinct). Plot is a reliable tool.
- **Big P Plot vs. Little p plot:**
    - **Big P Plot (Capital P):** The overall story concept; what the book is fundamentally about (e.g., "Destroy the One Ring"). The logline or brief summary.
    - **Little p plot (Lowercase p):** The chapter-by-chapter, scene-by-scene events and problem-solving that keep the reader engaged and move the story forward incrementally (e.g., "How do we get past these orcs?").

**II. The Core Framework: Promise, Progress, Payoff**

- This framework underlies most effective plotting, regardless of specific structural models (like Hero's Journey, etc., which will be discussed later).
- It's applicable to both **Outliners** (who plan extensively upfront) and **Discovery Writers/Pantsers** (who discover the story as they write).
    - Discovery writers often use these concepts more *analytically* during revision to fix problems.
    - Outliners use them during the planning phase.
    - Both approaches require significant time investment (upfront planning vs. backend revision).
- This framework is a powerful **diagnostic tool** for identifying why a story might not be working. Problems often arise from misalignments between these three elements.

**III. Promise**

- **Definition:** Setting expectations for the reader early in the story. Telling them what kind of experience they are in for.
- **Importance:** Crucial for hooking the reader and establishing the "contract" for the story. The first few pages/chapter(s) are critical for reader retention (often more so than just the first line). Established authors have an advantage here due to pre-existing trust ("name on the cover").
- **Timing & Revision:**
    - Don't over-stress perfecting promises *before* writing.
    - It's relatively easy to revise early chapters to align promises once the Progress and Payoff are clearer. Fixing large sections of Progress is harder.
    - Rewriting opening chapters after finishing a draft is common and recommended.
- **Types of Promises:**
    - **Tone Promise:** Establishes the *feel* of the story (e.g., humorous, grimdark, whimsical). Achieved through:
        - Prose style and word choice.
        - Naming conventions (e.g., Stark vs. Dumbledore).
        - Opening scenes (e.g., violent prologue for a grimdark story).
        - Prologues are often used in SFF to promise epic scope or action when the main plot starts slow (e.g., *Star Wars*, *Wheel of Time*). Use judiciously to avoid clichÃ©.
    - **Plot/Conflict Promise:** Hints at or directly states the central conflict or goal of the story.
        - Can be explicit (e.g., "We must destroy the Death Star").
        - Can be metaphorical (e.g., character struggling with a small, symbolic problem).
        - If the main conflict appears late, the opening might focus more on Tone and Character promises.
    - **Character Promise:** Introduces the protagonist, their desires, needs, flaws, and initial obstacles. What does the character want/need, and why can't they have it?
    - **Microcosm Promise (Cold Open):** Presents a mini-story at the beginning that reflects the larger story's themes, character skills, or plot structure (e.g., *Indiana Jones* opening sequence).
    - **Series Promises:** For multi-book stories, establishing the linking element (e.g., an overarching quest, a family saga, continuing adventures of a character).
- **Flexibility:** Promises can be introduced or modified later in the story, especially in longer works, often coinciding with character arcs or plot shifts. Tone can also shift if handled deliberately and promised correctly.

**IV. Progress**

- **Definition:** The sense of forward movement and development within the story, fulfilling the Promises made. It's the bulk of the narrative (90%).
- **Authorial Control:** Writers have absolute control over pacing and the passage of time. The goal is to create a *satisfying sense* of progression.
- **Pacing:**
    - The speed at which the story unfolds.
    - Should generally match the story's genre and tone (e.g., thrillers often faster, character studies slower).
    - **Variation** is key: Mixing faster and slower moments provides rhythm, allows for breathers, and makes high-tension moments more impactful. Constant high pace can become numbing.
- **Types of Progress & Signposting (Crucial):**
    - Progress must be *visible* to the reader. This requires **signposting**.
    - The *type* of progress should align with the story's core Promises and eventual Payoff. Examples:
        - **Information Progress (Mystery):** Measured by clues discovered, information revealed, suspects eliminated. Signposted by detective's insights, visual clue boards, etc.
        - **Relationship Progress (Romance/Buddy Cop):** Measured by increasing understanding, trust, or affection between characters, overcoming initial conflict. Signposted by shared moments, vulnerability, teamwork.
        - **Goal/Action Progress (Adventure):** Measured by obstacles overcome, distance traveled, steps taken towards a physical objective. Signposted by reaching milestones, defeating intermediate foes.
    - Stories often weave **multiple types** of progress (e.g., *Guardians of the Galaxy* has adventure progress and relationship progress). Identify the *most important* thread that defines the story's soul.
- **Alignment is Key:**
    - Page-turners effectively align Progress with Promises and signpost it clearly.
    - "Boring" or confusing sections often result from a **misalignment**: The Progress being shown doesn't feel relevant to the Promises made (e.g., a perceived side quest that distracts from the main goal - *Last Jedi* Finn example, *Oathbringer* detour example).
    - **Fixing Misalignment:** Often involves revising *Promises* (adding stakes or new goals to justify the current path) rather than throwing out the Progress entirely.
- **Practicalities:** Time jumps ("Three weeks later") are acceptable tools for managing progress, especially when signaled clearly (e.g., chapter/part breaks).

**V. Payoff**

- **Definition:** The resolution and fulfillment of the Promises, driven by the Progress made. It should feel both **surprising and inevitable**.
- **Achieving "Surprising Yet Inevitable":**
    - **Inevitability:** Comes from clearly laying the groundwork through Promises and Progress. The ending feels earned and logical based on what came before.
    - **Surprise:** Comes from:
        - **Obstacles & Escalations:** Raising the stakes and making the reader doubt whether the promise can be fulfilled (Plausible Deniability).
        - **Misdirection/Red Herrings:** Leading the reader to expect a different outcome temporarily.
        - **Making the Audience Forget:** Building tension so intensely that an earlier promise, when fulfilled, feels like a sudden, welcome relief (e.g., Gandalf arriving at Helm's Deep).
        - **Twists:** (See below).
- **The Role of Twists:**
    - **Not Mandatory:** Many great stories deliver exactly what was promised (e.g., *Pride and Prejudice*). Complications and escalations are often more important than twists.
    - **Effective Twists:** Often work by changing the *nature* of the promised payoff in a way the audience comes to desire or accept.
        - *Over-delivery:* Promised a toy car, delivered a real car.
        - *Substitution:* Promised a toy car, but made the audience want a toy plane through the story's Progress, then delivered the plane (e.g., *While You Were Sleeping*).
        - *Subversion/Deconstruction:* Challenging the initial promise and offering something different, often more complex or realistic (e.g., *Into the Woods*). Requires making the audience question or desire the shift.
- **The Goal:** A satisfying Payoff creates strong emotional resonance â€“ relief, excitement, catharsis, chills. It makes the journey feel worthwhile. When Payoffs land effectively (like Helm's Deep), the story feels magical; when they feel unearned or like a deus ex machina (like the Army of the Dead potentially perceived), the impact is lessened.

**VI. Conclusion & Application**

- Understanding Promise, Progress, and Payoff provides a robust framework for both creating and analyzing plots.
- While foundational, the best teacher is the act of writing and revising itself. Use these concepts as tools, particularly when diagnosing why a story isn't working.
- Be willing to adjust Promises (even killing darlings) to better align with the compelling Progress and satisfying Payoff your story discovers along the way.

# Lecture 3 - Plot Theory: Story Structures

**I. Introduction: Purpose of the Lecture**

- This lecture provides a **survey** of various plot structures and models used by writers.
- These are presented as **tools** for writers to investigate further and experiment with.
- The goal is to spark ideas and help writers strengthen their plotting, building upon the previous week's concepts of Promise, Progress, and Payoff.
- The best method is subjective: it's the one that helps *you* consistently produce the work you intend to, at your current skill level.

**II. Foundational Reminders on Plot**

- **Core Function:** Plot exists primarily to provide **Conflict**. ("The king died" is a fact; "The king died and then the queen died of grief" introduces causality/conflict, forming the basis of story).
- **Story vs. Events:** A story is not just a sequence of events, but the **struggle** characters undergo (emotionally, through character arcs) in response to those events.
- **Showing Progress:** Plot demonstrates progress (or change from the status quo) to the reader. This can include:
    - Forward movement towards a goal.
    - Learning new information.
    - **Regressive Progress:** Characters backsliding or declining (e.g., *Breaking Bad*), where the *story's* progress is tracking this negative character arc.
- **Making Obstacles Meaningful:** Obstacles shouldn't just be random events. They should serve a purpose within the plot and character development. Effective obstacles tend to:
    1. **Force Growth:** Compel the character or plot to develop or change.
    2. **Reinforce Growth/Learning:** Confirm a character's breakthrough or the relevance of previously learned information/clues.
    3. **Show Failure/Highlight Flaws:** Demonstrate that a character isn't ready, highlighting their internal struggles or the antagonist's strength, often leading to escalation (e.g., mentor figures dying - Obi-Wan, Gandalf - forcing protagonists to grow).

**III. Cautionary Note on Frameworks (The Chef vs. Cook Analogy)**

- **Flexibility is Crucial:** Avoid treating any framework as sacrosanct or a rigid checklist. This can lead to forcing elements into a story where they don't fit, potentially harming the narrative.
- **Example:** George Lucas's potential over-reliance on the Monomyth checklist in the *Star Wars* prequels (e.g., adding the virgin birth element).
- **Goal:** Use frameworks as guides or diagnostic tools, but be willing to adapt, modify, or discard them if they conflict with the story's organic needs. Be a chef who understands principles, not just a cook following a recipe.

**IV. Survey of Plot Frameworks**

- **A. The Hero's Journey / Monomyth (via Dan Harmon's Story Circle)**
    - **Origin:** Popularized by Joseph Campbell (*Hero with a Thousand Faces*), simplified by Dan Harmon.
    - **Core Concept:** A cyclical journey of transformation, often representing the transition from ignorance/stasis to experience/mastery.
    - **Basic Structure:**
        1. Character in a zone of comfort/stasis.
        2. A Need/Call to Adventure arises.
        3. Resistance/Refusal of the Call.
        4. Crossing the Threshold (Point of No Return).
        5. Road of Trials (Testing, learning, facing challenges).
        6. Meeting with Divinity / Confronting Inner Darkness/Father Figure.
        7. Paying a Price / Transformation / Gaining the "Elixir" (knowledge/skill).
        8. Return / Master of Two Worlds (Spiritual & Physical), improving the original world.
    - **Usefulness:** Emphasizes character growth, learning, and the power of returning to the familiar to demonstrate change. Its vagueness allows it to fit many stories.
    - **Criticisms/Caveats (for Writers):** Can feel too prescriptive; Campbell's academic rigor is debated (source issues, potential bias); easy to apply superficially.
    - **Variations:** Can be used for negative arcs (Greek Tragedy - character fails a key step) or layered across multiple characters or installments (e.g., *Star Wars* original trilogy).
    - **Tropeyness:** Don't obsess over avoiding tropes inherent in the structure. Focus on finding your voice and mastering influences rather than simple avoidance.
- **B. Yes, But / No, And**
    - **Origin:** Often associated with screenwriting; useful for discovery writing.
    - **Core Concept:** Generating plot through a cascading series of *escalating* complications. Creates natural momentum and rising stakes.
    - **Mechanism:** For a given problem/goal:
        - Does the character succeed? -> **Yes, but...** [introduce a new complication or consequence].
        - Does the character succeed? -> **No, and...** [introduce a worsening of the situation or a new problem].
    - **Usefulness:** Drives constant forward momentum and tension. Excellent for thrillers, screwball comedies, or building intensity within specific sequences. Can track character arc attempts as well.
    - **Caveats:** Can lead to burnout if used relentlessly over very long narratives; may require periods of consolidation or reflection.
- **C. Try/Fail Cycles & Points on the Map**
    - **Origin:** Points on the Map (Robert Jordan), Try/Fail Cycles (Dave Wolverton). Favored by discovery writers or hybrids.
    - **Points on the Map:**
        - Outline major plot beats, reveals, or "destinations" (like landmarks on a road trip).
        - Discovery write the connections between these points.
        - Allows foreshadowing and a sense of direction without detailed scene-by-scene planning. (e.g., *Wheel of Time*, potentially *Harry Potter*).
    - **Try/Fail Cycles:**
        - Before succeeding at a significant task, characters should attempt it and *fail* intelligently at least once (often multiple times).
        - Failures should stem from character flaws, lack of skill, or being outmaneuvered by a competent antagonist.
        - Demonstrates the difficulty of the task and justifies character growth needed for eventual success. Addresses "why didn't they just..." audience questions. (e.g., Luke learning the Force, failing against Vader).
    - **Plot Holes & Believability:** Avoid "gorilla in the phone booth" issues â€“ elements so jarring or illogical they pull readers out. Address major concerns (perhaps via Try/Fail or "hanging a lantern"), but accept that minor inconsistencies are inherent in storytelling. Focus on issues flagged by beta readers, not hypothetical "plot holes."
    - **Insurmountable Problems:** Distinguish between character flaws (to be overcome), handicaps (self-imposed limitations, e.g., moral codes), and external challenges (obstacles to be navigated, not necessarily "solved," like a lost limb).
- **D. Three-Act Structure**
    - **Origin:** Hollywood standard (popularized by Syd Field, *Save the Cat*, etc.).
    - **Core Concept:** A structure emphasizing rising conflict leading to a decisive climax. Often described as an arrow pointed at an explosion. Effectively four parts (Act 1, Act 2A, Midpoint, Act 2B, Act 3).
    - **Structure:**
        - **Act I:** Introduction (Character, Setting, Status Quo), Establish Need, Inciting Incident (kicks off the causal chain), Refusal/Hesitation, Establish Major Dramatic Question (What the story will answer, often related to the character). Ends with **Plot Point 1** (Point of No Return, commitment to the journey).
        - **Act II:** Rising Action ("Throwing rocks at the character"). Obstacles increase, stakes escalate, character attempts solutions but lacks skill/knowledge. Contains the **Midpoint** (Major twist, escalation, reframing, or making the conflict deeply personal â€“ often the most crucial beat). Continues with more frantic attempts, higher consequences, leading to the **All Is Lost Moment / Plot Point 2** (Lowest point, apparent failure).
        - **Act III:** Climax. Driven by a last chance realization from Act II. The final confrontation where the Major Dramatic Question is answered. Resolution follows.
    - **Usefulness:** Provides a clear, tension-building structure familiar to Western audiences. Concepts like the Midpoint and Plot Points are broadly applicable even outside rigid adherence.
    - **Adaptation:** Film adaptations often impose this structure onto source material (e.g., *Lord of the Rings* films), which can be effective but may alter the original feel. Necessary changes for the medium are different from poor adaptation choices.
- **E. Structure Model / Genre Model**
    - **Core Concept:** Analyzing a specific sub-genre or plot archetype (e.g., underdog sports story, heist movie, revenge tragedy) across multiple examples. Identify the core structural beats and emotional triggers that make it effective.
    - **Mechanism:** Adapt this identified structure to your own story, often transplanting it into a different genre, setting, or context.
    - **Example:** Sanderson using the "underdog team" structure (*Hoosiers*, *Miracle*, *Cool Runnings*, *Pitch Perfect*) for the Bridge Crews plotline in *The Way of Kings*.
    - **Usefulness:** Provides a proven, resonant structure to build upon. Excellent practice for understanding *why* certain plots work and allows for creative adaptation (being a "chef"). Good springboard if struggling with original plot generation.

**V. Learning and Application**

- **The Learning Curve (LSV Analogy):** Learning plot structures is like learning a complex game.
    - **Beginner:** Focus on fundamentals (just writing consistently, basic story flow). Trying to juggle all frameworks is overwhelming.
    - **Intermediate:** As basics become instinct, consciously focus on specific elements (e.g., the Major Dramatic Question, stronger obstacles).
    - **Advanced:** More complex structures and nuances become intuitive, allowing focus on higher-level craft.
- **Use as Tools:** Apply these frameworks consciously during outlining or revision (especially for diagnosis when something feels wrong), but trust developing instincts during drafting. Don't let them paralyze the creative process.

# Lecture 4 - Plot Theory: Q&A

**I. Reinforcing the Core: Promise, Progress, Payoff**

- **Promise:** Sets reader expectations, crucial for engagement.
- **Progress:** Keeps readers invested through the bulk of the story.
- **Payoff:** Creates satisfaction, determines if readers return for the next book. Poor payoff usually leads to negative reviews (*especially* 2-star reviews indicating disappointment) rather than readers abandoning the *current* book.

**II. Expanding on Promises**

- **Beyond Tone Promises:** Other crucial promises include:
    - **Little p Plot Promise:** What kind of immediate conflicts/activities will the story involve? (Big P Plot promise often comes later, around the end of Act I).
    - **Character Promise:** Who is the character? How do they solve problems? (e.g., Mulan using wits unconventionally).
    - **Character Arc Promise:** What does the character want ("I Want Song")? How might they change or grow?
    - **Stand-Up-and-Cheer Moment Promise:** Foreshadowing a moment of eventual triumph, especially for characters starting weak or downtrodden (e.g., Captain America's transformation). Helps readers endure the character's struggles.
    - **Specific Element Promise (Chekhov's Gun):** Highlighting an object or detail signals its future relevance. This expectation can be fulfilled directly or subverted (used as a red herring).

**III. Addressing Plot Originality**

- **General Advice:** Don't overstress originality, especially early in your career. Your unique voice will emerge naturally through practice.
- **When It's a Valid Concern (Consistent Feedback/Personal Dissatisfaction):**
    1. **Go Deeper:** Identify standard tropes/beats. Instead of following them, ask "What's a different, more interesting/deeper decision?" and make that choice work for the character and story (e.g., Sanderson's revision of Kaladin's arc from *Way of Kings Prime*).
    2. **Transpose:** Move the familiar plot structure to a completely different genre or setting. Use the *new* context's tropes and conventions to force interesting changes (e.g., *10 Things I Hate About You* as a Shakespeare retelling).
    3. **Deconstruct:** Analyze the flaws or unexamined aspects of a common trope or story structure. Build your story around exploring those flaws (e.g., *Mistborn*'s premise asking "What if the Dark Lord won?"). Deconstruction often still relies on reader familiarity with the original tropes.
- **Caution on Twists/Deconstruction:**
    - Don't twist *just* for surprise. Ensure the twist makes the story *better* or more interesting. Simple surprise is easy and often ineffective.
    - If significantly subverting genre expectations (especially late in the book), foreshadow this *early* (through tone, hints, etc.). Otherwise, you risk alienating both fans of the original genre (who feel betrayed) and fans of deconstruction (who put the book down early). Building author trust through previous works can help deliver such twists later.

**IV. Handling Series and Unfulfilled Promises**

- **Acceptable Unfulfillment:** It's normal and expected in a series to leave major (Big P Plot) promises unfulfilled in early books, *provided* you fulfill significant *other* promises (e.g., major character arcs, resolving substantial subplots).
    - *Example:* *Fellowship of the Ring* doesn't destroy the Ring but fulfills the promise of the Ring's corrupting influence and resolves the Fellowship's initial journey. *Way of Kings* resolves the Bridge Crew arc, even if the series' main conflict is just beginning.
- **First Book Strategy:** For breaking-in authors, it's generally recommended to write a book with a **complete story and sequel potential**, rather than ending on a major cliffhanger that relies entirely on future installments. Demonstrate you can deliver a satisfying ending. Don't save all the cool stuff for later books.
- **Serialized Structure:** Alternatively, write a series where each book is a self-contained arc (common in genres like mystery or urban fantasy).

**V. Creating Climactic Moments (Stand-Up-and-Cheer)**

- **Internal Before External:** Often most effective when a character's internal resolution/decision (Character Arc Payoff) immediately enables or leads into the external plot resolution (Plot Payoff). (e.g., Han returning -> Luke trusting the Force -> Death Star destroyed). The success feels earned through character choice.
- **Earned Through Suffering:** Moments can also resonate simply because the audience has seen the character endure immense hardship, making their eventual success (even if seemingly small) a huge relief (e.g., Captain America finally wielding Mjolnir).
- **Staggering Multiple Payoffs:** In complex narratives with multiple converging arcs:
    - Avoid "numbness to awesome" by having too many climaxes happen simultaneously.
    - Often better to stagger major payoffs. Resolve some arcs definitively (perhaps at a midpoint or 2/3 mark) to provide satisfaction and allow focus to shift to the remaining primary arcs. (Sanderson used this in *Wheel of Time* wrap-up).

**VI. Exposition and Learning Curves**

- **The Challenge:** Sci-Fi/Fantasy inherently requires conveying worldbuilding, magic systems, history, etc. (Exposition) to the reader, creating a learning curve. Steeper curves require readers to learn more upfront.
- **Common Mistakes:**
    - **Info Dumps:** Large blocks of explanatory text, especially early on. Avoid prologue exposition dumps common in older fantasy.
    - **"As You Know, Bob" / Maiden & Butler Dialogue:** Characters telling each other things they obviously both already know solely for the reader's benefit.
- **Effective Exposition ("Spinach in the Smoothie"):**
    - Goal: Deliver necessary information without the reader *feeling* like they're being lectured.
    - **Integrate, Don't Dump:** Weave exposition into dialogue naturally, connect it to character motivations and ongoing plot conflicts.
    - **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Demonstrate concepts through action or character interaction (e.g., *The Hobbit*'s opening showing Bilbo's nature, the existence of dwarves/wizards, and the quest setup through the dinner scene).
    - **Deliver Incrementally:** Provide only what's needed *now*. Don't frontload everything.
    - **Use Character Attention:** Readers notice what characters notice. Use character focus to highlight important world details.
    - **Dialogue Highlighting Mystery:** Characters explicitly noting something doesn't make sense within the established rules can be effective foreshadowing/exposition delivery ("Hanging a Lantern").
- **Managing Steep Learning Curves:**
    - **Slow Burn Start (Portal Fantasy Model):** Begin in a familiar setting (our world or analogous) to establish character and stakes before introducing the fantastical elements. Lengthens the intro but eases the curve. (Common in MG/YA, also seen in classic Quest Fantasy like *Wheel of Time*, *Lord of the Rings*).
    - **Genre Conventions:** Modern readers often understand genre basics ("This is fantasy, I get it"), allowing steeper curves than in the past.
    - **Authorial Choice:** Sometimes a steep curve is part of the artistic intent (e.g., Malazan).

**VII. Foreshadowing Techniques & Diagnosis**

- **Ease of Revision:** Foreshadowing is one of the *easiest* things to adjust during revision (adding hints, removing/obscuring obvious ones). Discovery writers should rely heavily on this.
- **Effective Foreshadowing Tips:**
    - **Reader Expectations:** Play with genre tropes. Readers often anticipate certain patterns; use this for misdirection or subtle hints.
    - **Rule of Three:** A basic guideline â€“ mention something about three times before it becomes crucial.
    - **Character Attention:** What characters focus on, worry about, or discuss signals importance to the reader. Use secondary characters' reactions/observations to highlight things about the protagonist or world.
    - **Explicit Questioning:** Characters noting inconsistencies or mysteries ("This doesn't make sense...") directly flags it for the reader as important.
- **Diagnosing Foreshadowing (Using Beta Readers):**
    - Ask *when* they guessed twists. Aim for most readers guessing just before the reveal.
    - If *everyone* guesses too early: dial back foreshadowing or lean into dramatic irony (reader knows, character doesn't).
    - If *no one* guesses: foreshadowing might be too obscure (unless it's meant as a pure complication, not a setup/payoff twist).
- **Reader Psychology:** Studies suggest readers often enjoy stories *more* if they know the twists beforehand (reduces anxiety, allows focus on execution). Don't panic if some readers guess correctly; focus on making the journey and payoff satisfying regardless. Avoid changing established plotlines solely because readers figured them out early.

**VIII. Practical Writing Process Advice**

- **Sanderson's Outline Method:**
    1. Identify major plotlines (external plot, character arcs, romance, information/mystery).
    2. For each plotline, brainstorm key moments, progress markers, setbacks, and the final payoff/climax. List these as bullet points.
    3. Interweave the bullet points from all plotlines into a chronological sequence for the book outline.
    4. Group sections into Parts, often marked by major turning points or resolutions.
    5. Build chapters from this interwoven list during the actual writing process. (Uses Microsoft Word with Document Map).
- **Maps:** Create maps (even simple hand-drawn ones) if spatial relationships, travel times, or army movements are important for consistency and verisimilitude.
- **Choosing Plot Ideas:** Often a "vibe thing" â€“ pick what's most exciting or what fits a deadline.
- **Using Beta Readers for Pacing:** Ask "Where were you bored?" or "Where did you want to put the book down?". Writing groups are less reliable for overall pacing due to chunked reading. Analyze boring scenes: can the information be delivered more dynamically?
- **Handling Memory Loss Plots:** Rely heavily on engaging Little p Plots (immediate problem-solving). Each solved problem reveals fragments of the past/larger plot. Build suspense through questions raised. Use flashbacks strategically.
- **Satisfying Character Failure:**
    - **Series Context:** Failure is acceptable if the reader knows more story is coming (*Empire Strikes Back*).
    - **Tragedy/Just Deserts:** Satisfying if the failure feels like the earned consequence of the character's flaws or actions (*Butch Cassidy*).
    - **Bittersweet Victory:** The main goal fails, but something smaller/important is achieved, or a glimmer of hope remains (*Fellowship*'s ending with Sam).
- **Longer Resolutions:** Generally fine if earned. Readers often enjoy lingering in the world if they are invested. Don't worry excessively about standard structure if the extended ending feels emotionally right (*Return of the King*, *The Dark Knight*).

# Lecture 4.5 - Plot Theory: Bonus Q&A

**I. Crafting Specific Character Arcs & Plot Types**

- **A. Writing Effective Betrayal Arcs:**
    - **Foundation:** Treat it structurally like a Relationship Plot, but have it turn sour.
    - **Establish the Bond:** Start by strongly showing *why* the characters work well together or are close friends. This initial connection makes the eventual break impactful. Readers will often ignore early warning signs if the bond is established effectively.
    - **Introduce Divergence:** Gradually show diverging motivations, increasing friction, and instances where they hinder rather than help each other.
    - **Protagonist's Perspective:** Use the protagonist's lingering trust and positive view of the friend to mask the worsening situation from the reader until the critical moment.
    - **Motivation is Key:** Ensure the betrayer has a solid, understandable reason for their actions. The reveal should feel surprising yet inevitable in retrospect.
    - **Foreshadowing:** Subtly foreshadow the *breakdown* of the relationship while overtly highlighting the *strength* of the initial bond.
- **B. Promising and Delivering Bittersweet Endings:**
    - **Early Signaling:** Indicate early on that the world isn't one where everything resolves perfectly (show past losses, casualties, harsh realities).
    - **Balance is Subjective:** Use beta readers to gauge the perceived balance of bitter vs. sweet elements and adjust if needed.
    - **Character Growth = More Sweet:** Endings where the character achieves personal growth/overcomes internal flaws tend to feel *more sweet*, even if the external Big P plot fails.
    - **Personal Cost = More Bitter:** Endings where the external Big P plot succeeds but at great personal cost to the character tend to feel *more bitter* (*Frodo*'s fate).
    - **Triumphant Sacrifice:** Characters achieving personal goals/fulfilling their arc *while* dying to achieve the external plot goal often feels more triumphant than bitter.

**II. Advanced Plotting Techniques**

- **A. Layering Internal & External Conflict:**
    - **Goal:** Weave a character's internal struggles (flaws, handicaps, growth needs) with the external plot events, making them influence each other dynamically.
    - **Signposting:** Clearly establish both the internal arc promise and the external plot promise early on.
    - **Show Progress & Failure:** Track both arcs throughout the story, showing incremental progress *and* significant failures on the internal journey.
    - **Internal Drives External:** Use the character's flaw/struggle to directly cause external complications or failures.
    - **Maintain Sympathy:** Crucially, ensure the reader understands *why* the flaw exists (make it relatable/human) and doesn't grow to dislike the character for their struggles. Have the character (or narrative) acknowledge the flaw and the need to overcome it ("Hang a Lantern").
    - **Climactic Synergy:** Aim for a climax where resolving the internal struggle directly enables success in the external conflict (the "one-two punch").
- **B. Try/Succeed Cycles vs. Try/Fail Cycles (Why *Dune* Works):**
    - **Try/Fail is Common:** Most stories utilize cycles where characters fail intelligently before succeeding, justifying growth.
    - **Try/Succeed *Can* Work:** Paul Atreides in *Dune* largely succeeds externally after his initial failure (father's death/exile). This works because:
        1. **Tragic Framing:** *Dune* is fundamentally a tragedy. Paul's external successes are interwoven with his *internal failure* â€“ compromising his values, manipulating religion, unleashing galactic jihad. The reader gradually realizes his "success" is horrifying.
        2. **Competence Porn:** Watching highly competent characters execute complex plans against high stakes is inherently engaging (*Dirk Pitt* example).
        3. **High Stakes & Constant Tension:** Even if success is frequent, if failure *at any point* means catastrophe, the tension remains high. The reader wonders *if this* will be the time they fail.
        4. **Scope Expansion:** Success in one phase can reveal a much larger, more daunting challenge, justifying continued effort (e.g., Frodo reaching Rivendell only to realize the quest is much bigger).
- **C. Combining Plot Archetypes:**
    - **Richness Through Layering:** Novels often benefit from weaving multiple plot archetypes together (*Mistborn* combining Heist, Master/Apprentice, Mystery, Romance, Revolution).
    - **Analyze Subtypes:** Recognize variations within archetypes (e.g., Heist structure of *Italian Job* â€“ plan disrupted, adapt â€“ vs. *Ocean's 11* â€“ plan executed brilliantly, watch it unfold).
    - **Transitions:** Skillful writing involves modulating between archetypes or transitioning from one to another as the story evolves (*Mistborn* Heist -> Revolution; *Knives Out* Whodunit -> Cat & Mouse).
    - **Experimentation:** Finding effective combinations requires practice, analysis of existing stories, and willingness to revise (Try/Fail cycles in your own writing). Transposing archetypes across genres is a powerful tool.

**III. Medium-Specific Plotting Considerations**

- **A. Written Word vs. Screenplays:**
    - **Advantages of Books:**
        - **Interiority:** Direct access to character thoughts and feelings builds connection quickly and deeply.
        - **Space:** More room for subplots, nuance, character depth, slower pacing, more complex try/fail cycles, red herrings.
        - **Reader Participation:** Lack of visuals requires reader imagination, making them co-creators of the experience.
    - **Plotting Implications:** Allows for more meandering, subtle foreshadowing, and potentially more spectacular twists due to the greater complexity and internal access possible.
- **B. Writing for Video Games:**
    - **Player Agency:** Plot must account for player control and choices, which inherently limits traditional narrative structures.
    - **Integration is Key:** The most effective game narratives often tightly integrate story elements with game mechanics.
    - **Diegetic Mechanics:** Making gameplay elements (like death/respawn) part of the story world (*Borderlands*) can enhance immersion and narrative coherence.
    - **Payoff Through Choice:** Often, the narrative payoff comes from the *consequences* of significant player decisions (*Mass Effect*).
    - **Avoid Ludonarrative Dissonance:** Be wary of cutscenes or plot events that contradict established gameplay rules (e.g., permanent character death despite available resurrection mechanics).
    - **Spectrum of Interactivity:** Game narratives range from minimal plot/environmental storytelling (*Elden Ring*) to highly directed interactive movies ("Walking Simulators"). Understand where your game sits on this spectrum.

**IV. Determining the Scale of Plot**

- **Length Dictates Scope:** Longer books (>120k-150k words) generally require and lead readers to expect a larger scope (world-ending stakes, generational sagas, full lifetimes). Shorter novels/novellas suit more contained stories.
- **Reader Experience:** Shorter books (~80-100k) can often be read in one sitting, lending themselves to high-intensity pacing (Thrillers, some Romance). Longer epics are read over time, requiring pacing breaks, strong chapter/part structures, and immersion.
- **Pacing Adjustments:** Use chapter length strategically â€“ shorter chapters pull readers through faster (good for climaxes), longer chapters allow deeper immersion.
- **Experience & Intuition:** Writers develop a feel for how long a story needs to be through practice and outlining. Be prepared to adjust scope during the writing process if the story demands more (or less) space.

# Lecture 5 - Character Theory: Proactive, Relatable and Capable Characters

**I. Introduction: The Goal of Compelling Characters**

- **Problem:** Traditional creative writing courses often neglect *how* to create compelling characters, a fundamental aspect of engaging fiction.
- **Solution:** This lecture introduces a framework for understanding and building characters readers connect with.
- **Core Principle:** Compelling characters generally possess a mixture of three key attributes: **Proactivity**, **Relatability**, and **Capability**.
- **Flexibility:** Most characters excel in one or two areas while being weaker or developing in another. The framework helps identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential arcs.
- **Leveraging Passion ("Write What You Know" Redefined):** Draw on your unique passions, knowledge, and life experiences (or those of people you know) to inform character traits, motivations, and arcs. This adds authenticity and depth (e.g., Dan Wells and serial killers).

**II. The Three Pillars of Compelling Characters**

- **A. Proactivity:**
    - **Definition:** The character takes action, makes decisions, and actively influences the plot's direction.
    - **Importance:** Arguably the *single most important* trait for making a character readable. Readers naturally bond with characters who *make the story happen* and get frustrated by passivity.
    - **Mechanism:** Proactive characters drive progress, fulfilling the reader's desire to see the story unfold.
    - **Example:** Jack in *Lost* â€“ his immediate, decisive action in the crisis makes him the focal point, despite potential relatability issues.
    - **The Villain Problem:** Villains are often inherently proactive (scheming, acting) while heroes might be initially reactive, leading audiences to find villains more interesting.
    - **Cultivating Proactivity in Heroes:**
        - **Give Them Wants:** Even small desires (Kurt Vonnegut's "cup of coffee" - *Hudson Hawk*) create initial drive and action.
        - **Establish Clear Motivations:** Characters feel "alive" when their actions clearly stem from understandable (even conflicting) wants and needs. Motivation issues often underlie characters feeling "wooden."
        - **Show Proactivity in Small Ways:** Even if the character resists the main call to adventure, show them being proactive in their *own* lives or solving smaller problems (*Mulan* feeding chickens creatively).
        - **Handle Limited Proactivity:**
            - *External Limits (Prison):* Show internal proactivity (planning, thinking, small acts of agency within constraints like getting extra bread).
            - *Internal Limits (Mental Health):* Difficult to portray engagingly. Focus on *motion* (even downward spirals like Sazed's depression arc) rather than stasis. Alternatively, lean heavily on Relatability and Capability if Proactivity is severely limited.
    - **Competing Proactivity:** Creates excellent conflict and tension when two characters actively pursue opposing goals (*The Fugitive*).
- **B. Relatability:**
    - **Definition:** Qualities that make a character understandable, likeable, or allow the reader to empathize and connect. Essential for raising stakes.
    - **Importance:** Helps readers invest emotionally, especially in high-stakes (sci-fi/fantasy, thriller) narratives.
    - **Methods to Increase Relatability:**
        - **Kindness / "Save the Cat":** Showing basic moral decency and altruism (*Captain America* pre-serum). The opposite ("Kick the Dog") clearly signals villainy.
        - **Liked/Respected by Others:** Demonstrates the character's positive qualities through the eyes of other characters (*Way of Kings* Ch 1 viewpoint).
        - **Self-Awareness:** Characters who recognize their flaws and *try* to be better, even imperfectly, gain reader sympathy (*Mr. Darcy*).
        - **Common Ground / "Normalcy":** Giving characters relatable desires, habits, or struggles (*Garfield* hating Mondays).
        - **Moral Compass:** A generally understandable ethical framework (even if flawed) allows readers to connect.
    - **Flaws and Relatability:** Introducing flaws initially *increases* relatability but becomes a liability if the character doesn't address or grow beyond them over time (potential for reader frustration - *Lost*'s Michael problem).
    - **Villain Relatability:** Strong villains often possess a relatable motivation, past trauma, or understandable (if warped) perspective, adding depth (*Magneto*).
    - **Antiheroes:**
        - *Classical:* Passive character refusing the protagonist role (*Madame Bovary*).
        - *Modern Pop Culture:* Often a "villain protagonist." Made compelling via high Proactivity/Capability, pitted against worse antagonists. Allows exploration of moral gray areas (*John Wick*, *Punisher*). True antiheroes wrestle with the consequences of their morally dubious actions.
- **C. Capability:**
    - **Definition:** Competence, skill, or effectiveness in areas relevant to the plot.
    - **Importance:** Readers admire competence and enjoy seeing skilled characters overcome challenges.
    - **"Competence Porn":** Stories centered on highly capable individuals consistently succeeding (*Dirk Pitt*). Works if stakes are high and competence is well-demonstrated.
    - **Balancing Capability:**
        - *Too Much:* Can decrease relatability if unchecked (*Classic James Bond* vs. *Casino Royale* reboot).
        - *Effective Balance:* Characters are typically strong in some areas and weak in others. Strengths drive plot; weaknesses/flaws create conflict and require growth or workarounds.
    - **Diverse Capabilities:** Capability isn't limited to physical prowess. It includes loyalty (*Samwise Gamgee*), intelligence, emotional strength, specific knowledge, etc. Identify the character's unique strengths.

**III. Character Arcs within the Framework**

- **Definition:** An arc represents movement along one or more of the Proactivity, Relatability, and Capability scales.
- **Common Arcs:**
    - **Learning Proactivity:** Moving from reactive to active.
    - **Increasing Relatability:** Overcoming flaws, becoming more self-aware or empathetic.
    - **Increasing Capability:** The "apprentice to master" journey, gaining skills/knowledge.
- **Relationship to Flaws, Restrictions, Limitations (Preview of Sanderson's Second Law):**
    - **Flaws:** Internal character issues *to be overcome* (driving Relatability/Capability arcs).
    - **Restrictions:** Self-imposed or story-imposed rules the character adheres to, creating conflict but not meant to be "overcome" (*Superman's* moral code).
    - **Limitations:** External, often unchangeable challenges (physical disability) that must be *worked around* (testing Proactivity/Capability).
    - *Note:* How these interact and are overcome (or not) defines much of a character's internal journey and arc.

**IV. Conclusion**

- Understanding the interplay of Proactivity, Relatability, and Capability provides a powerful lens for analyzing and creating compelling characters.
- Focusing on motivations, wants, and how characters navigate their strengths and weaknesses within this framework leads to richer, more engaging characterization.

# Lecture 6 - Character Theory: Customizing your Character

**I. Introduction: Moving from Core Function to Presentation**

- **Recap:** Last week focused on the *core functions* of character in narrative (Proactivity, Relatability, Capability) â€“ what makes them work structurally.
- **Focus Today:** This lecture addresses how characters are *presented* to the audience â€“ the elements that make them memorable and distinct. This is often what readers perceive as the most important aspect of character.

**II. Iconic Characters (vs. Dynamic Characters)**

- **Definition:** Characters who generally do *not* undergo significant internal change or arcs across multiple stories or installments (originated from Howard Tayler).
- **Purpose:** Often used in series designed to be read out of order or where the focus is primarily on external conflict and competence.
- **Examples:** James Bond, Dirk Pitt, Hercule Poirot, potentially characters in series like *The Babysitter's Club* or *Hardy Boys*. Raoden from *Elantris* is cited as having a primarily external/apprentice arc rather than deep internal change.
- **Narrative Question:** For iconic characters, the core question shifts from "Will the character learn/grow?" to "Will their established competence be enough to overcome this specific (often escalating) external threat?" or "What will be the *cost* of their success?"
- **Validity:** While character arcs are generally recommended, iconic characters serve a valid and often enjoyable function, particularly in genre fiction focused on action, mystery, or adventure. They can still experience poignant *situational* emotional journeys within a single story, even without fundamental personality change.

**III. The Core Triad of Character Presentation**

- **Overview:** Beyond the functional triad (Proactivity, Relatability, Capability), the *presentation* of a character relies on effectively conveying their **Motivation**, **Personality**, and **Values**. These are interconnected.
- **Definitions:**
    - **Motivation:** What the character *wants*. (The "Why?")
    - **Personality:** *How* the character expresses themselves and pursues what they want. (The "How?")
    - **Values:** What the character is (or isn't) *willing to do or sacrifice* to get what they want. (The "Limits/Costs?")

**IV. Deep Dive: Motivation (Revisited)**

- **Foundation:** Understanding motivation remains the most crucial first step in building a believable character.
- **Discovery Process:** Motivations often emerge during the writing process, even for outliners. Sanderson outlines plot/world heavily but discovers character specifics (Motivation, Personality, Values) while writing, then adjusts the outline accordingly. This prevents rigidity and allows characters to feel organic. (e.g., Multiple drafts needed for Vin and Kaladin).
- **Key Questions for Finding Motivation:**
    - **Backstory:** How does past history inform present decisions? (Doesn't always need to be tragic). What key past decisions shaped them?
    - **Secrets:** What don't they want known? How does this influence choices?
    - **Failures:** What past failure haunts them? How do they handle blame/regret?
    - **Wants/Needs (Classic Hollywood):** What do they want? Why can't they have it? What do they *need*? What must they sacrifice to get it?
    - **The Underlying "Why":** Continuously ask *why* the character wants what they want.
- **Methods for Exploration:** Dossiers (lists of questions), visual inspiration (finding a picture), but ultimately finding the *core fundamentals* of the character.
- **Core Fundamentals:** Identify the few essential principles driving the character. This allows the author (and eventually the reader) to anticipate their likely actions and reactions consistently. Deviations from these core fundamentals require explicit explanation within the narrative.
- **Villain Motivations:**
    - Avoid generic "destroy the world" motives (Pat Rothfuss quote: "That's where all their stuff is!").
    - Ground motivations in understandable (even if extreme) reasons (*Magneto*'s trauma leading to preemptive strike).
    - Alternatively, use *Iconic Villains* where motivation is less important than their function as an external force (*Sauron*), often balanced by a more relatable secondary villain (*Gollum*).
    - Tragic Flaws: Often, villains are potential heroes twisted by a flaw, frequently the willingness to go to extremes others won't.

**V. Deep Dive: Personality (The Expression)**

- **Definition:** How the character manifests their motivations and values through action, dialogue, and behavior. How they *go about getting* what they want (aggressive, passive, direct, indirect, etc.).
- **Initial Impression:** Characters inevitably start as reader-perceived stereotypes/archetypes ("the wallflower," "the hothead"). The writer's job is to add nuance and depth over time.
- **Establishing Personality:**
    - **Early Actions & Dialogue:** Crucial for initial impressions. Show, don't just tell.
    - **Contradictions:** Starting with an internal contradiction can immediately signal complexity for a *main* character (less recommended for minor side characters initially).
    - **Dialogue:** Powerful tool.
        - *Avoid "Maid and Butler":* Don't have characters state motivations plainly.
        - *Show, Don't Tell:* Reveal personality through word choice, sentence structure, rhythm, interaction style.
        - *Practice Exercise:* Write a three-person scene with no tags/description, relying solely on distinct voices to track who's speaking.
        - *Cues (Use Sparingly):* Accents, dialects, specific verbal tics (Gambit). Less is more in prose; suggest rather than write phonetically heavily. Avoid clichÃ©s (e.g., hyper-formal speech = intelligence).
        - *Intelligence via Structure:* Show intelligence through organized thought, complex sentences, rhetorical devices, quick references, wit â€“ not just big words or lack of contractions (*Ken Jennings* example).
- **Quirks:**
    - **Purpose:** Memorable, distinguishing traits.
    - **Effectiveness:** Most effective when the quirk *reinforces* or relates to a core aspect of the character's motivation, values, or personality, rather than feeling random or tacked on (*Reckoners*' David's bad metaphors vs. *Frugal Wizard's* rating system).

**VI. Handling Character Groups & Distinctiveness**

- **Making Background Characters Distinct:**
    - **Visual Signifier:** A memorable physical trait (glasses, distinctive clothing item) helps readers track initially.
    - **Distinctive Motivation/Quirk:** A recurring behavioral tic or unique interaction style (Robert Jordan's Aiel relationship with water).
    - **Stereotype Awareness:** Initial distinguishing traits *will* stereotype the character. Either lean into it (for minor/comedic characters like Lopen) or deliberately add depth later.
    - **Adding Depth:** Use later viewpoint scenes, heart-to-heart conversations, or show variations within a cultural group to move beyond the initial stereotype.
- **Managing Cast Size:**
    - **Exponential Complexity:** Each added viewpoint *significantly* increases complexity and book length.
    - **New Writers:** Starting with 1-2 viewpoints is often advisable. Two viewpoints allow for A/B plot structure, cutting boring travel/waiting time.
    - **Proximity Matters:** Multiple viewpoints interacting in the *same* location/plotline add less complexity than characters scattered across different locations with separate goals.
    - **Sub-Viewpoints:** Adding a secondary viewpoint within an existing character's plotline (Adolin within Dalinar's) can add depth without dramatically increasing overall scope/complexity.
- **Contrast is Key (Ensemble Casts):**
    - Highlight differences in how characters react to the same situation or stimulus (*Fellowship* members reacting to the One Ring).
    - Establish initial roles ("the tough one," "the smart one") and build nuance from there.

**VII. Specific Character Challenges & Techniques**

- **Annoying Characters:**
    - **Reader Tolerance:** Readers tolerate annoying characters if the *plot is still progressing*. Stalling the plot is the bigger sin.
    - **Mitigation:** Have the viewpoint character also find them annoying; use the annoyance for humor (*Shrek* annoyed by Donkey); ensure the annoying character serves a purpose (emotional heart, plot catalyst). Question why the character *needs* to be annoying.
- **Hated Characters (Villains):**
    - **Love-to-Hate:** Often highly competent/proactive but morally reprehensible in ways that are titillating rather than deeply disturbing. Their downfall is anticipated (*Thanos*).
    - **True Hate:** Make them exploit the heroes' specific weaknesses, limitations, or moral codes. Target their cruelty effectively.
- **Shifting Motivations / Character Development:**
    - **Core of Arcs:** Most good character arcs involve a shift in motivation driven by new information or experiences (*Kuzco*).
    - **Show the Process:** Establish initial motivation, then show experiences that challenge it, leading to gradual adoption of new values/goals. Use try/fail cycles related to the *new* desired state.
    - **Relate to Values:** Changing motivations often stem from acquiring or prioritizing different values.
- **Introspective Characters / "Navel Gazing":**
    - **Challenge:** Can slow pacing if not handled well.
    - **Solutions:**
        - *External Force:* Use plot events to continually pull the character back into action.
        - *Compelling Voice:* Make the character's internal monologue and observations so witty, insightful, or unique that the reader enjoys it for its own sake (*Jane Austen*, snarky YA, some first-person romance).
        - *Reader Expectations:* Understand that some genres/readers *value* introspection and voice over pure plot momentum (*Hitchhiker's Guide*). Lean into it if appropriate, but be mindful of pacing. Editors often trim excessive introspection.
- **Writing "The Other" (Different Backgrounds/Experiences):**
    - **Research:** Read primary sources, especially accounts of "what media gets wrong" about a specific experience.
    - **Individuality:** Remember people are individuals; don't make your character a perfect monolith representing an entire group. Give them unique traits alongside shared experiences.
    - **Sensitivity Readers:** Have people *from that background* read your work and provide feedback. Be prepared to revise based on their insights (e.g., fighter pilots for *Skyward*, DID readers, deaf readers for *Tress*). Pay them if possible.
    - **Avoid Harm:** Be conscious of perpetuating harmful stereotypes, especially as an author with a large platform. Authenticity improves the story for *all* readers (Curb Cut Effect analogy).

**VIII. Dialogue Techniques**

- **Avoid Dragging:** Break up long speeches with interjections, actions, or shifts in focus. Make dialogue interactive, not just exposition. Treat arguments like action scenes.
- **"In Late, Out Early":** Start scenes close to the core conflict/information exchange and end them soon after it's resolved. Trim unnecessary lead-up/wind-down.
- **Reader Preference:** Readers generally prefer dialogue over narration, *if* the dialogue is engaging and moves things forward. Strive for balance.

# Lecture 7 - Setting Theory: Sandersonâ€™s Laws of Magic

**I. Introduction: Worldbuilding in Service of Story**

- **Context:** Sanderson developed these "laws" as personal guidelines, often learned from mistakes, to improve his magic systems and storytelling. They are principles, not unbreakable rules.
- **Relative Importance:** While crucial for Sci-Fi/Fantasy, Worldbuilding (including magic systems) is generally *less* foundational to a successful story than strong Plot and Character.
    - Strong Plot + Strong Characters + Weak Worldbuilding = Often still a strong story.
    - Strong Worldbuilding + Weak Plot/Characters = Often a weak story (potentially just an encyclopedia/RPG guide).
- **Goal:** Worldbuilding should *serve* the narrative (Plot and Character), not exist solely for its own sake (though personal enjoyment in creation is valid).

**II. Sanderson's First Law: Solving Problems with Magic**

- **The Law:** *Your ability to solve problems in a satisfying way with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.*
- **Origin:** Developed after a panel discussion contrasting Sanderson's "rules-based" approach (common in Epic Fantasy) with Urban Fantasy/Horror writers who emphasized mystery and lack of control.
- **Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems (Spectrum):**
    - **Hard Magic:** Reader understands (or can learn) the rules, limitations, and costs. Magic often functions like a science. Allows characters to strategically *use* magic to solve problems.
    - **Soft Magic:** Rules are unknown, vague, or inconsistent. Emphasizes wonder, mystery, or horror. Magic often *creates* problems or adds atmosphere, rather than being a tool for direct problem-solving by protagonists.
    - **Spectrum, Not Binary:** Many systems mix elements (e.g., *Harry Potter*: hard rules within a book, soft overall; *Lord of the Rings*: One Ring = mostly hard, Gandalf = mostly soft).
- **Internal vs. External Logic:**
    - **Internal Logic (Crucial for Hard Magic):** The magic system is consistent *within itself*. Rules, once established, are followed. (e.g., Superman's powers from the sun - source doesn't need real-world logic, just consistency).
    - **External Logic (Optional Flavor):** Using real-world science concepts (physics, biology) to explain or structure the magic. Lends verisimilitude, aids reader understanding (grokability), but doesn't determine hardness/softness. (e.g., X-Men gene, Mistborn physics).
- **Narrative Purpose:**
    - **Hard Magic:** Allows magic to be a tool for *protagonist-driven problem-solving*. Requires foreshadowing capabilities and costs. Violating established rules leads to unsatisfying Deus Ex Machina endings.
    - **Soft Magic:** Creates atmosphere (wonder/horror), emphasizes forces beyond protagonist control, complicates situations rather than resolving them directly. Resolutions often rely on character wit, mundane solutions, or external forces (sometimes unsatisfyingly, like *War of the Worlds*, if not handled intentionally).
- **Application:**
    - If magic solves the climax, the reader needs to understand how it works beforehand (*Helm's Deep* Gandalf example - the *structure* of his arrival was foreshadowed, even if his specific powers were soft).
    - If magic *doesn't* solve the climax, it can remain soft. Focus payoff on character growth, non-magical solutions, or emotional resolution (*Wizard of Oz* example - character virtues rewarded symbolically, unrelated to magic rules).
    - *Mistborn 1* Ending Example: Sanderson admits violating this law by introducing a new, unforeshadowed power for the climax, leading to a Deus Ex Machina feel. A learning experience.
- **Seeding Information (Hard Magic):**
    - Avoid info dumps. Integrate explanations into action, dialogue, character interaction, or training scenes.
    - Show, don't just tell. Demonstrate rules and limitations through use.
    - Introduce complexity gradually. Start with core concepts, add layers later.
    - Err on the side of *more* foreshadowing/clues than you think you need; scale back based on beta reader feedback if twists are guessed too easily.

**III. Sanderson's Second Law: Flaws, Limitations, and Costs**

- **The Law:** *Flaws, limitations, and costs are generally more interesting than powers themselves.* (Often paraphrased as "Limitations > Powers").
- **Origin:** Realization after *Mistborn*'s magic (inspired by telekinesis) felt original not because of the core power (similar to Magneto), but because of its *specific constraints* (push/pull vectors, weight differences, metal source costs) which forced strategic use.
- **Why It Works:** Limitations force creativity, strategy, and create inherent conflict. Overcoming challenges *despite* limitations is compelling. Powers without meaningful constraints can become boring or lead to easy solutions.
- **Types of Constraints (Expanding on Previous Lecture):**
    - **Costs:** What must be expended or risked to use the magic? (Economic - metals; Physical - fatigue; Intellectual - study; Moral/Mystical - sacrifice). Costs dictate frequency and scale of use.
    - **Limitations:** Inherent boundaries of what the magic *can* and *cannot* do. The fundamental rules. (Allomancy only pushes/pulls directly). Readers expect characters to *work within* these.
    - **Flaws (Narrative Definition):** Aspects of the magic system presented as *broken or incomplete* that characters are expected to *fix or overcome*. (Elantris's magic not working correctly).
    - **Hindrances (Narrative Definition):** Lines the characters *could* cross (morally, ethically) using the magic, but choose not to (or the story explores the consequences if they do). Creates tension around temptation.
- **Application to Character:** This law applies equally to characters. Their weaknesses, struggles, and internal conflicts are often more engaging than their innate strengths or talents (*Superman*'s vulnerabilities and human connections are where his best stories lie).
- **Intersection:** The most interesting stories often arise from the intersection of flawed/limited characters interacting with flawed/limited magic systems (*Name of the Wind* example: Kvothe's character flaws hindering his grasp of soft magic).

**IV. Sanderson's Third Law: Expand or Deepen?**

- **The Law:** *Before adding something new (magic system, culture, plotline), first explore the depth and potential of what you already have.* (Often paraphrased as "Expand what you have before you add something new").
- **Origin:** Reaction to the hype/pressure to make *Stormlight Archive* vastly more complex than *Mistborn* just for complexity's sake, and recognizing that *Way of Kings Prime* failed partly due to over-complication (too many character arcs).
- **The "Ocean an Inch Deep" Problem:** Avoid creating vast worlds or systems where individual elements lack depth, nuance, or consequence (like *Daggerfall*'s repetitive dungeons). Prioritize depth over sheer breadth.
- **Application:**
    - **Magic Systems:** Can a character use the *existing* magic in a new, unexpected way? Are there unexplored facets or consequences of the current rules?
    - **Cultures/Religions:** Would exploring schisms, heresies, or related branches of an *existing* culture/religion be more interesting than inventing a completely new one? (e.g., Judaism/Christianity relationship).
    - **Plotlines/Characters:** Can existing characters or relationships be explored more deeply before introducing numerous new ones?
- **Goal:** Create interconnectedness, resonance, and meaningful complexity rather than just a sprawling collection of underdeveloped ideas. Focus makes for stronger narrative impact. (Skyrim's handcrafted dungeons vs. Daggerfall's procedural ones).

**V. Final Thoughts**

- These laws are tools to help structure thinking about worldbuilding and its narrative function.
- The ultimate goal is to create engaging stories where worldbuilding, character, and plot work together harmoniously.
- Experimentation and understanding *why* certain approaches work (or don't) is key to developing craft.

# Lecture 8 - Setting Theory: Tools for Worldbuilding

**I. Introduction: Deeper Dive into Worldbuilding Principles**

- **Recap & Focus:** Building on Sanderson's Third Law (Depth > Breadth), this lecture explores *how* to make worldbuilding a highlight and integrate it effectively with plot and character. It also includes a segment on Viewpoint and Tense as presentation tools.
- **Idea Genesis:** Novels typically arise from an intersection of multiple compelling ideas (Plot, Character, Setting hooks). Don't wait for one perfect idea; look for synergy between several good ones. (e.g., *Mistborn*: "Dark Lord Won" setting + "Heist" plot + existing magic system idea).
- **Worldbuilding in Service of Story (Revisited):** Design worldbuilding elements (like magic systems) to enhance the core plot and character roles (e.g., designing Allomancy powers to fit traditional heist crew roles).

**II. The "Write What You Know" Principle for SFF**

- **Interpretation:** For SFF writers, "Write What You Know" means drawing upon your unique **passions, interests, life experiences, and fascinations**. Mine these for authentic details and inspiration.
- **Authenticity & Uniqueness:** Your specific combination of interests and experiences allows you to create settings and stories no one else could. Don't shy away from incorporating expertise or areas you *want* to learn more about.
- **Example:** Driving through fog led to the Mists in *Mistborn*. Personal or observed quirks can inspire characters.

**III. The Process of Worldbuilding (Sanderson's Method)**

- **Initial Brainstorm:** Start by listing all existing ideas under Plot, Character, and Setting headings.
- **Integration & Synergy:** Combine existing ideas and pull from external "cool stuff" notes, always asking: Does combining these ideas make them *more interesting* and create *depth*? Focus on interconnections (Sanderson's Third Law). (e.g., "Dark Lord Won" setting informed the deconstruction of Chosen One/Prophecy tropes in *Mistborn*).
- **Categorization (Sanderson's Document Structure):**
    - **Physical Setting:** Elements existing independent of sapient life (topography, weather, geology, flora/fauna, astronomy, planetary physics).
    - **Cultural Setting:** Elements created by sapient beings (technology, religion, food lore, social mores/taboos, law/government, language, education, fashion, architecture, traditions, festivals).
    - **Magic System:** Treated as its own major category due to importance in SFF, though it interacts with both Physical and Cultural settings.
- **Avoiding Worldbuilder's Disease:**
    - **Definition:** The paralysis caused by the overwhelming depth possible in any worldbuilding element, leading to endless planning and no writing.
    - **Sanderson's Solution:** Set time limits for initial worldbuilding. Start writing and discover *what* needs more development based on the story's emerging needs. Don't try to perfect everything upfront. Prioritize elements relevant to plot and character decisions/challenges. (e.g., Realizing a justice system was more critical than linguistics for a murder mystery plot).

**IV. The Iceberg Metaphor & Evocative Worldbuilding**

- **Traditional Iceberg:** The idea that much worldbuilding remains unseen below the surface, informing the visible parts.
- **Sanderson's "Hollow Iceberg":**
    - **Visible Tip:** What's explicitly shown/explained in the text.
    - **Shallow Submerged Part:** The elements you *actually* need to develop in detail because they directly impact plot, character, or core themes. Do this research/creation well.
    - **Deep Hollow Part:** Elements you *evoke* or hint at, creating a *sense* of depth without needing full development upfront. Rely on reader assumptions, genre conventions (FTL, dragons), or leave intriguing hooks for later exploration.
- **Avoiding Info Dumps:** The goal is reader immersion, not encyclopedia entries. Focus on *showing* the world through character experience.
- **Evocative Description:** Use specific, sensory details to ground the reader. Describing one highly detailed, representative element can imply the rest of the environment (Dan Wells' "describe one thing well" technique). (e.g., Show the spice shimmering on Arrakis, feel the heat, *then* delve into Paul's internal struggles). Concrete sensory experience anchors abstract concepts.

**V. The Pyramid of Abstraction**

- **Concept:** A tool for grounding abstract concepts (emotions, complex ideas, unfamiliar settings) in concrete sensory details within a scene.
- **The Paradox:** Things we think of as abstract (like "love") are often quite concrete in shared human experience, while seemingly concrete things (like "a dog") are abstract until specified (what *kind* of dog?).
- **Application:**
    - Use specific, sensory language ("small wet poodle huddled in the rain") to pull abstract concepts down the pyramid, making them tangible and shared for the reader.
    - Anchor scenes with concrete details (sights, sounds, smells, textures) *before* or *during* more abstract internal monologue ("navel gazing") or exposition. This keeps the reader grounded in the scene.
    - Balance concrete grounding with necessary abstraction. Too much description bogs down; too much abstraction detaches the reader ("white room" effect). Find the rhythm that works for your style.
- **Goal:** Make the fantastical feel real and immediate through concrete sensory experience, earning the reader's engagement with more abstract worldbuilding or character introspection.

**VI. Naming Conventions**

- **Method 1: Atlas/Cultural Inspiration:** Draw sounds/styles from real-world regions, ideally ones you have familiarity with or that match the culture you're creating. *Pitfalls:* Accidental real words/meanings, cultural appropriation concerns (be mindful, specific, and respectful; consider fraught histories).
- **Method 2: Linguistic Study:** Learn basic linguistic principles (phoneme frequency, word length related to sound inventory, conjugation patterns) to create consistent-sounding constructed names/languages without full conlanging.
- **Method 3: Linguistic Trick:** Choose a simple rule (symmetry, repeated sounds, specific letter combinations) to create a unified feel for names within a culture.
- **Check Your Work:** Google names to avoid unintentional slurs, swear words, or awkward real-world associations. Use beta readers familiar with relevant languages/cultures.

**VII. Viewpoint and Tense (Tools for Presentation)**

- **Core Choices:**
    - **Person:** First (I), Second (You - rare), Third (He/She/They).
    - **Tense:** Past (Standard for adult SFF), Present (Standard for contemporary YA), Future (Rare/Experimental). *Note:* The functional difference between Past and Present tense on reader experience is often minimal; choice is largely convention/preference.
- **Third Person Varieties:**
    - **Third Limited:** Standard SFF. Follows one character's perspective per scene/chapter. Allows deep dives but maintains narrative distance. Can "zoom out" slightly at beginnings/endings.
    - **Third Omniscient (True):** Narrator knows all thoughts/events, can shift viewpoint paragraph-by-paragraph. Creates distance, relies on *suspense* (reader knows more) over *mystery*. Requires careful handling to avoid feeling disjointed (*Dune*).
    - **Third Omniscient (Storyteller):** Narrated by a distinct persona *telling* the story. Allows narrator commentary, flexible viewpoint shifts, but frames the story as recounted (*The Hobbit*, *Tress*).
- **First Person Varieties:**
    - **Epistolary:** Story told through documents (letters, journals). Creates realism/immediacy but limits perspective (*Dracula*, *Illuminae*).
    - **First Intimate/Close:** Standard YA. Direct feed from character's thoughts/experiences *as they happen*. Highly immersive, limited scope.
    - **First Narrator:** Character recounting past events ("When I was young..."). Allows for reflection, foreshadowing by the narrator, but inherently spoils survival up to the point of telling (*Name of the Wind*, *Assassin's Apprentice*).
- **Strengths & Weaknesses:**
    - **Third Person:** Better for large casts (clearer who's speaking/thinking), smooths disparate viewpoints into a cohesive narrative, easier to manage scope.
    - **First Person:** Highly immersive, strong voice potential, excellent for character studies, allows easier justification for "info dumps" via narrator personality/digressions. Can feel limiting with large plots/casts. Harder to manage multiple first-person viewpoints without confusion.
- **Mixing Techniques:** Possible but requires clear purpose and execution (e.g., contrasting tenses for different POVs - *Speed of Dark*; frame stories - *Name of the Wind*, *Princess Bride*). Reader needs to understand *why* the shift occurs.
- **Unreliable Narrators:**
    - Works in most viewpoints.
    - *Third Limited:* Hardest to execute without feeling like cheating the reader. Requires subtle clues (character contradictions, hyperbole) that the perspective is skewed (*Wheel of Time*'s Mat). Acknowledging secrets ("can't think about that now") is a common, if sometimes weak, workaround.
    - *First Person (Narrator/Storyteller):* Easiest, as the narrator's bias/agenda/memory flaws are inherent to the format. Explicitly signaling untrustworthiness can be part of the contract with the reader.

# Lecture 9 - Setting Theory: Worldbuilding on Earth

**I. Introduction: Deep Dive into Worldbuilding Application**

- **Focus:** This lecture addresses specific worldbuilding questions, building on the concepts of Sanderson's Laws and the "Hollow Iceberg" metaphor.
- **Reminder:** Next week focuses on the Business of Writing (Traditional Publishing focus, but questions on Indie are welcome).

**II. Worldbuilding in Real-World Settings (Urban Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Historical)**

- **Advantages:**
    - **Shortcuts:** Can leverage reader's existing knowledge of the real world (e.g., don't need to explain football, basic physics, common technologies). Genre conventions allow further shortcuts (e.g., accepting wormholes in Sci-Fi without detailed explanation).
- **Challenges & Pitfalls:**
    - **Accuracy Matters:** Easier for readers (especially experts) to spot factual errors (geography, history, science, culture). Errors undermine credibility ("makes me so angry" effect).
    - **Research Intensity:** Requires significant research to avoid major errors, especially in specialized areas (military details, specific historical periods like WWII).
    - **Sensitivity & Representation:** Higher risk of mishandling real-world cultures, religions, or marginalized groups. Misrepresentation can be damaging and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.
- **Strategies:**
    - **Increased Research:** Dedicate time to understand the real-world elements you're incorporating.
    - **Expert Readers:** Utilize alpha/beta readers with expertise in the relevant fields (military personnel, historians, scientists, people from the specific culture/background).
    - **"Bonehead" Characters:** Use viewpoint characters who are *unfamiliar* with the area of expertise, allowing exposition or corrections to occur naturally within the narrative (e.g., Kaladin disliking/not understanding horses).
    - **Respectful Depiction:** Be conscious and deliberate in your portrayal of real cultures/groups. Avoid accidental appropriation or stereotyping. Do the research to understand nuances. (*Rule: Depict others as you'd want to be depicted*).
    - **Contrast:** Effectively use the contrast between the *known* real world and the *introduced* fantastical/sci-fi elements to highlight the speculative aspects (e.g., *Yesterday* premise - Beatles don't exist).

**III. Viewpoint & Tense (Revisited & Expanded)**

- **Mastering Descriptions (Robert Jordan/George R.R. Martin Technique):**
    - Filter *all* descriptions (setting, people) through the *specific viewpoint character's* perspective, biases, and voice.
    - How a character describes a grassy hill, a cup of water, or another person reveals *their* personality and background.
    - Distinctive voice and perspective should make the viewpoint clear even without explicit naming. Use strong opening paragraphs to establish POV.
    - Turns descriptive passages into characterization and potential foreshadowing. Enhances immersion, especially in epic fantasy.
- **Getting into Character Heads (Tips):**
    - **Lead with Name:** Often helpful to mention the POV character's name early in the scene/chapter.
    - **Clear Action/Focus:** If mentioning another character first, ensure the main action or focus clearly belongs to the POV character ("X watched Y do...")
    - **Zinger Descriptions:** Use concise, impactful descriptive lines that reflect the POV character's voice early in the scene.
    - **Essay Structure (Micro):** Apply basic thesis-support-conclusion structure even to paragraphs within the character's voice to maintain clarity and focus.
    - **Practice:** Fluency comes from writing and reading critically, noticing how authors manage POV.
- **Handling Worldbuilding Characters Aren't Interested In:**
    - **Narrative Signaling:** Use external cues (teacher emphasizing importance, plot consequences) to signal relevance to the *reader*, even if the character tunes out.
    - **Weave into Character Goals:** Connect the "boring" worldbuilding to something the character *does* care about (e.g., needing to learn about security systems to reach a desired object).
    - **Alternative Viewpoints:** Cut to a character who *is* interested in that information.
    - **Delay/Hint:** Introduce the concept briefly, have the character dismiss it, and bring it back when it becomes directly relevant.
    - **Epigraphs/Appendices (Use with Caution):** Can convey dense info, but a significant portion of readers skip them. Don't rely on them for *essential* plot information.

**IV. Introducing New Elements Late in the Story**

- **General Risk:** Introducing major new elements, characters, or plotlines late (e.g., 3/4 mark) risks disrupting narrative momentum and feeling like a Deus Ex Machina or unnecessary complication (Sanderson's cut *Elantris* character example).
- **Effective Late Introductions:**
    - **Foreshadowed Threats:** Looming problems that arrive as expected can effectively signal the final act (*Death Star arrival*).
    - **Seeding for Sequels:** Introduce hints or elements relevant to the *next* book near the end, often in epilogues or post-credit-scene equivalents (*MCU Thanos* example). Resolve the current book's main plots first.
    - **Expanding Scope:** Reveal that the initial conflict was part of a larger world/problem, naturally leading to future stories (*Maze Runner* concept).

**V. Tools and Process for Worldbuilding**

- **Research Methods:** Use a mix â€“ online research, reading books (non-fiction, primary sources), and asking/interviewing experts or people with relevant lived experience.
- **Learning Efficiency:** Initial research yields the most significant understanding quickly. Aim for a solid foundation (e.g., 50% knowledge) and refine through writing and expert feedback, rather than aiming for 100% mastery before starting (risk of Worldbuilder's Disease).
- **Worldbuilding Software:** Wikis (like Obsidian, World Anvil, or even locally hosted ones like older WikiDPad) are useful for organizing interconnected information (characters, places, magic rules). Sanderson primarily uses Microsoft Word for outlining/writing and an internal team-managed wiki for reference. Consistency with *your* preferred tool is key.

**VI. Specific Worldbuilding Challenges & Techniques**

- **Original Geography:**
    - **Foundation:** Basic understanding of geology, meteorology (rain shadows), ecology helps create plausible foundations *to then break* with magic/fantastical elements.
    - **Inspiration:** Draw from real-world unique locations (slot canyons -> Shattered Plains), striking visuals (fog banks -> Mists), non-fiction science articles, documentaries.
    - **"Awesome" Over Strict Realism (Sanderson's Zeroth Law):** Start with the cool fantastical concept, then work backward to justify it within the world's internal logic. Fantasy allows bending/breaking real-world physics *if* internally consistent.
- **Show, Don't Tell (Nuance):**
    - **Show:** Use actions, sensory details, dialogue to demonstrate concepts/character traits. More immersive, takes more words. (Poke frog -> explosion).
    - **Tell:** State information directly. More efficient, less immersive. (Saying "frogs explode if poked").
    - **Journeyman Level:** Know *when* to use each. Telling is fine (and often better) for efficient setup, summarizing time/events, or stating clear facts when elaborate showing is unnecessary or awkward. Showing is better for emotional impact, key character moments, and core worldbuilding reveals.
- **Naming:** (Covered previously - Atlas method, Linguistic study, Linguistic trick, Google checking).
- **Handling Similar Names/Concepts:** Assess how prominent the existing work is and how generic the term is. Minor overlaps are usually fine. If it's iconic ("The Force") or causes reader confusion, reconsider. Beta readers can help flag issues.
- **Crafting Battles:**
    - **Fantastical Battlefields:** Create unique settings, magic interactions, or ecologies that define the rules of engagement, giving you control and avoiding reliance on potentially flawed real-world tactics (Sanderson's preferred method - Mistborn fights, Shattered Plains).
    - **Real-World Analogs:** Study historical battles (Aginourt, Waterloo). Adapt the strategic flow and beats to your setting, focusing character drama *within* that framework. Easier shortcut for realistic-feeling tactics.
    - **Logistics:** Consider how armies are supplied (magic can provide shortcuts, like Soulcasting food, altering traditional constraints).

**VII. Advice for Developing Writers**

- **Writing Books:** Useful for specific techniques/perspectives (*On Writing*, *Writing to Sell*, *Save the Cat*, Orson Scott Card's books), but **practice is paramount**. Don't substitute reading *about* writing for actual writing. Theory is best applied *after* gaining practical experience.
- **Getting into the Workshop:** Selection often prioritizes writers demonstrating consistent practice (finished works), fulfilling program requirements (BYU majors), and nearing professional quality in their writing sample. (And avoid vampires for Karen).
- **Focus on Fundamentals:** Master core skills (prose, dialogue, basic structure, consistent writing habits) before overly stressing advanced techniques or originality concerns. Craft develops through iteration and completing projects.

# Lecture 10 - How Publishing Works

**I. Introduction: Understanding the Industry Context**

- **Purpose:** This lecture provides a historical overview and structural breakdown of the traditional publishing industry, focusing on its impact on authors, particularly in SFF.
- **Format:** A "fire hose" lecture covering a broad range of topics quickly. Follow-up questions can be addressed next week or in the web Q&A.
- **Upcoming:** Next week delves deeper into agents, contracts, and specific business aspects.

**II. A Brief History of Modern Publishing & SFF**

- **Early Days:** Making a living solely from writing was rare until around the mid-19th century (Dickens era).
- **Pulp/Magazine Era (Golden Age of SF):** Early-to-mid 20th century saw SF, Fantasy, Horror, Detective fiction primarily in cheap, serialized magazines ("pulps"), considered lowbrow. "Serious" literature was published in prestigious hardcovers. This established a cultural divide between "literary" and "genre" fiction.
- **The Tolkein Effect & Genre Maturation:** Readers who grew up on pulps desired more mature stories with imaginative elements. J.R.R. Tolkein's *Lord of the Rings* was a landmark, treating fantasy with literary seriousness and proving its commercial viability. This coincided with similar trends in film (Spielberg, Lucas, Scorsese elevating genre filmmaking).
- **SFF Publishing's Grassroots Origins:** Mainstream publishers initially ignored SFF. The genre's publishing infrastructure often grew from fans, writers, and small presses meeting at conventions. This fostered a strong community but could also feel insular.
- **Paperback vs. Hardcover:** Initially separate entities. Hardcover publishers held prestige; paperbacks handled genre fiction and reprints. Eventually, hardcover houses bought paperback lines, merging formats under one roof.
- **The Rise of Bestsellers & Consolidation (70s-90s):**
    - SFF proves consistently profitable (McAffrey, Le Guin, etc.).
    - The "Blockbuster" era hits books and film. Hardcovers become the primary format for dedicated fans and generating higher profit margins.
    - Publishing houses begin consolidating into large conglomerates.
    - Independent bookstores decline as large chains (Barnes & Noble, Borders) rise.
    - Distributors consolidate, focusing on high-volume sellers and reducing reach into smaller markets (gas stations, etc.), beginning the decline of the "midlist."
- **The Wheel of Time Effect (90s):** Published by Tor (founded by Tom Doherty, specifically for hardcover SFF), *The Wheel of Time* becomes a consistent #1 bestseller, cementing hardcover SFF as a major market force.
- **The Returns System:** Established during the Great Depression to encourage bookstores to stock debut authors. Booksellers can return unsold copies to the publisher for credit. Still exists today, mitigating risk for bookstores but complicating royalty accounting for authors.

**III. The Digital Disruption: Ebooks & Audiobooks**

- **Ebook Revolution (circa 2010):** Amazon's Kindle platform proves dominant. Convenience ("one-click buy") and platform control are key.
    - **Initial Gold Rush (approx. 2010-2016):** Indie authors capitalized on publishers' slow adoption and high ebook prices. Huge growth in self-publishing.
    - **Market Stabilization:** Publishers adapt pricing/sales. Amazon introduces Kindle Unlimited (subscription model, often lower per-read payout for authors) and Amazon Ads (pay-to-play visibility), making indie success more challenging and reliant on marketing savvy/ad spend.
- **Audiobook Boom (Ongoing):** Driven by platforms like Audible offering subscription models and easy digital access. Became the fastest-growing segment.
    - SFF overperforms significantly in audio (long books offer high value per credit).
    - Author royalties often remain low despite high growth (similar issues to ebook splits).
- **Current Landscape:** Dominated by large conglomerates (The "Big Five" - Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, Hachette, Macmillan). Amazon holds significant power in retail and ebook/audio distribution.

**IV. Traditional Publishing Structure & Process**

- **Key Roles:**
    - **Publisher:** Top business executive overseeing an imprint or company. Focuses on profitability, strategy, managing the "nerds" (editors, creatives). Doesn't typically acquire books directly. (e.g., Tom Doherty).
    - **Associate Publisher / Editorial Director:** Manages editors, bridges creative and business sides. May or may not acquire books themselves. (e.g., Harriet McDougall).
    - **Editor (Acquiring Editor):** The "book person" who finds, champions, and acquires manuscripts. Acts as the **Project Manager** for a book, interfacing with all other departments. *This is who authors primarily interact with.*
    - **Publicity & Marketing (P&M):**
        - *Marketing:* Paid advertising (print, online - Amazon/TikTok ads), Co-op placement.
        - *Publicity:* Earned media, author events (tours), social media promotion, ARCs.
    - **Sales Force:** Historically visited individual bookstores; now primarily deals with large chains and online retailers.
    - **Art Department:** Creates covers, interior design.
    - **Accounting/Contracts:** Handles finances, royalties, legal agreements.
- **The Acquisition Process:**
    1. **Submission:** Primarily through literary agents now.
    2. **Editor Reads & Champions:** Editor finds a manuscript they love.
    3. **P&L Statement (Profit & Loss):** Editor creates a projection of potential sales, costs, and profitability based on comparable titles and market analysis (often "made-up numbers" but necessary).
    4. **Acquisition Meeting:** Editor pitches the book to superiors (Editorial Director/Publisher).
    5. **Offer:** Based on P&L, an offer (including an **Advance**) is made to the agent.
- **The Editorial Process:**
    1. **Editorial Letter:** Editor provides big-picture feedback (plot, character, pacing). Author revises.
    2. **Line Edits:** More detailed sentence-level feedback.
    3. **Copy Edits:** Focus on grammar, consistency, typos (often done by specialized copy editors, not the acquiring editor).
    4. **Proofreads:** Final checks for errors before printing.
- **Production & Release:** Editor coordinates cover art, marketing/publicity plans, printing, distribution.

**V. Author Compensation in Traditional Publishing**

- **Advance:** An upfront payment against future royalties. Author keeps it even if the book doesn't "earn out," unless they fail to deliver the manuscript. Typical debut advances might be $5k-$10k (though agents aim higher).
- **Royalties:** A percentage of the book's price paid to the author *after* the advance has been earned back. Standard rates (can vary):
    - **Hardcover:** 10% on first 5k copies, 12.5% on next 5k, 15% thereafter (of *cover price*).
    - **Trade Paperback:** ~7.5-10% (of *cover price*).
    - **Mass Market Paperback:** ~6-8% (of *cover price*).
    - **Ebook:** **25% of *net* receipts** (what the publisher receives *after* the retailer's cut - typically 70% of sale price). This is widely considered unfair to authors compared to print royalties.
    - **Audiobook:** Often also 25% of *net* (or variations based on specific deals).
- **Royalty Statements & Reserve Against Returns:** Publishers hold back a portion of royalties for a period to account for potential bookstore returns, delaying full payment.

**VI. Indie Publishing Considerations (Briefly)**

- **Viability:** Still a valid path to success, but the "gold rush" ease is over.
- **Requirements:** Professional editing, professional cover art (upfront costs).
- **Strategy:** Often relies on rapid release schedules (multiple books per year, even months) to build a backlist and capitalize on algorithms/virality. Requires significant marketing effort (ads, social media).
- **Royalties:** Potentially higher percentage per sale (e.g., 70% from Amazon direct), BUT requires covering all production costs and dealing with platform fees/ad costs.

**VII. Key Takeaways & Industry Issues**

- **Consolidation & Bestseller Focus:** Large publishers dominate, often prioritizing potential bestsellers over nurturing midlist authors.
- **Amazon's Dominance:** Significant control over ebook/audio markets and retail visibility creates challenges for both traditional and indie authors (pricing constraints, ad dependency, low royalty splits). Supporting diverse retailers is beneficial.
- **Ebook Royalty Disparity:** The standard 25% of net remains a major point of contention and financial disadvantage for traditionally published authors compared to print.
- **Premium Editions:** A growing market (special editions, Kickstarters) allows authors/publishers to offer high-value products to dedicated fans, potentially subsidizing wider/cheaper access (Sanderson's model). Retaining these rights is valuable.
