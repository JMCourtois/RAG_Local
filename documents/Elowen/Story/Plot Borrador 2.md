# Plot Main Events

### World Wrap Scenes

- A recon unit finds the Elowen Testament and gives it to Daelia (identity unknown to the reader initially). The text is written in an archaic or coded language that few can read, but Daelia possesses the knowledge to decipher it.

### Act I:

- **Prologue:** Elowen starts writing her testament, promising to explain her path to a foreseen tragic end.
- **Childhood (Recalled):**
    - Elowen experiences a relatively happy early childhood, marked by unusual empathy; she behaves maturely and considerately, often relating better to animals (whose emotions feel direct/honest) than people.
    - Her early Sight manifests subtly: feelings of déjà vu, occasional minor precognition (knowing trivial things that will happen), or intuitive knowledge/skill (**Involuntary Visions/Ambient Perception**).
    - **(To check)** Experiences overwhelming empathetic noise/sensory overload during a public gathering (e.g., festival, tense political rally), causing distress and highlighting her lack of psychic filters (**Uncontrolled Empathy/Noetic Field Sensitivity**). (This section could be used in order to make a foreshadowing of what is gonna happen once the event that has been announced by the counsel doesn't happen.
    - **(To check)** Accidentally forms a brief, uncontrolled Consciousness Link with a frightened animal (bird, stray dog), sharing its panic and potentially causing negative reactions from onlookers, reinforcing Sight as isolating/dangerous. (This could also be nice in order to show that the magic system is not only useful for humans. All conscious beings are related to it)
    - **[Implied during mother's withdrawal description]:** Abruptly, her mother withdraws affection after touching Elowen one day and reacting with shock; Elowen perceives fear and worry but receives no explanation, only seeing her mother retreat into intense research. The shock likely stems from the mother glimpsing something terrifying/powerful in Elowen via an involuntary psychic link during contact (perhaps Elowen's future potential or a raw connection to the Field/Nexus). This creates the emotional void.
    - Hears street talk and official Council announcements regarding an impending invasion; precautions are advised.
    - **(To check)** During invasion preparations, Elowen overhears hushed, fearful arguments between her parents she doesn't understand, hinting at underlying tensions potentially related to prophecies or Council directives.
    - Observes her father preparing diligently for the invasion, managing resources and training in combat.
    - Witnesses a conversation between her parents after which her father seems troubled. Shortly after, her mother disappears.
    - Her father abruptly ceases invasion preparations; Elowen interprets this as depression (unaware he likely knows the invasion threat is false/manipulated, possibly due to his wife's research/actions).
    - 
    - Spends a period learning about Elendora's culture and history from her father and tutors (opportunity for worldbuilding, perhaps including biased Council history). Is a way to make other foreshadowings that actually plant the seed of the lie of the counsel.
    
    - **(new)** Faces escalating **bullying or ostracization** from peers. They mock her for being "too sensitive," for her strange "lucky guesses," or recoil when she inadvertently reveals something personal she picked up empathically. Maybe she's nicknamed "Void-Eyes" or "Echo-Girl." Reinforces her feeling of being different and the **social risks of uncontrolled Sight**.
    - **(new)** Introduced to Daelia in a setting that contrasts their backgrounds (e.g., Elowen observing commoners' resilience in a market Daelia navigates easily). Daelia, perhaps delivering goods, notices Elowen's distress (from ambient noise) and offers a simple, practical kindness or distraction. They share a brief, honest conversation: Elowen speaks elliptically of feeling overwhelmed; Daelia mentions a fortune-teller (lesser Seer?) predicted she'd "make something beautiful endure" – a simple, positive prophecy contrasting Elowen's internal dread and hinting at Daelia's future significance/focus on preservation. Establishes Daelia's grounded nature and kindness. **(Character Intro & Contrast)**
    - I could make this section one where Elowen learns from Daelia some basic alchemy. And other fields to. I can put Daelia as the symbol of the freedom Elowen wants, that eventually (even if just for a couple of years) she gets at the end of the first book. While Elowen is learning about these different things Daelia shows her, she gets to know there are certain potions that block her empathy, and she will make use of that in the future. Because she can not simply turn it off. Even though she can get some distance from what she feels.
    - 
    - Early uncontrolled Sight manifestations (ambient noise, overwhelming empathy, involuntary animal links) intensify, causing fear and isolation, signaling the need for guidance.
    
    - **(new)** Senses a dissonance or 'wrongness' in the Council's confident invasion prediction but dismisses her own intuition due to self-doubt/fear of uncontrolled Sight (**Intuitive Vision vs. Authority Conflict**).
    - 
    - Her father, seeing her distress and perhaps fulfilling a promise to her mother, arranges for a formal Seer tutor from the Council ranks, acknowledging his inability to guide her Sight but perhaps subtly warning her about becoming *too* involved.
    - 
    - Begins formal Seer training.
    - **(new)** During Seer training, her tutor pushes controlling, rigid Council methods (e.g., forcing specific visualizations, blocking empathy, using sanctioned Focusing Tools) that clash violently with Elowen's intuitive/empathic Sight, causing painful psychic feedback or uncontrolled emotional outbursts. Tutor emphasizes suppressing empathy as 'noise' and instability (**Methodology Conflict: Conventional vs. Innate**).
    - Tutor criticizes her empathy as a weakness ("emotional contamination") and pushes **Consciousness Shielding** techniques (mental dissonance) that feel unnatural and isolating to Elowen.
    - Tutor attempts to teach basic **Memory Link** (object attunement) using Council-approved methods, but Elowen accidentally accesses deeper, more disturbing residual emotions from the object, frightening the tutor.
    - 
    - **(new)** Tutor introduces rudimentary, Council-approved **Noetic Notation** – simple glyphs for recording basic visions, emphasizing objective documentation over subjective experience. Elowen finds it inadequate for capturing the *feeling* or complexity she perceives. **(Magic System Exposition & Conflict)**
    - 
    
    - Experiences a traumatic, involuntary vision of Elendora's future destruction but keeps it secret due to fear/previous negative experiences with sharing visions (**Burden of Knowledge**).
    - Briefly assessed by a Council Seer (tutor or higher official) regarding the failed prediction fallout or her training issues; her empathic sensitivity and lack of rigid control lead to her being labeled "potentially unstable" or needing "corrective measures," reinforcing her sense of being dismissed/flawed (**Judged/Misunderstood by Authority**).
    - 
    - The forewarned invasion fails to occur, causing widespread public confusion and fear, shaking faith in the Council's infallibility. Quizá un vidente podría hacer ese error, pero el consejo contaba con decenas de videntes expertos. Un error de tal calibre a nivel de gobierno generó gran miedo en la población.
    - **(new)** After the failed invasion prediction, witnesses Council Seers enforcing stricter public controls or aggressively silencing dissenters/skeptics in the streets, revealing their authoritarian nature and control over information (**Council Control/Suppression Shown**).
    - 
    - **(new)** Briefly assessed by a Council Seer (perhaps same tutor) after the failed prediction; her uncontrolled empathy/chaotic perception is deemed unstable or inferior to disciplined foresight, reinforcing her feeling dismissed/flawed (**Judged/Misunderstood by Authority**).
    - Attempts and ultimately rejects conventional Seer training, potentially after a final, disastrous incident where Council methods fail her or cause harm, solidifying her belief they are ineffective/wrong for her.
    - 
    - Experiences a shattering, specific traumatic vision at age 16: vividly seeing *her own hand* involved in causing Elendora's future destruction (**Devastating Foresight/Self-Implication**).
    - This is a revelation point where she makes a theory why her mother stop talking to her. Her mother feared her, she felt threatened and perhaps discusted from her. Her own mother couldn’t love her after seeing what she saw. Elowen never tell Daelia about this. Till end of the Act I of the second book.
    - there must be ideas about free will and how things could be in a different way. To make Elowen and the readers believe in the first book, that destiny is actually something that can be changed. elowen sees different parts or expersions of herself, but what she doesnt know is that she will transition over all of them. She is not just one person, the man is not someone else to the child he once was. The man is both, the man and the child, as our perception of time is only that, our perception. But in the story time is a block.
    - Elowen remembers she can use alchemy to numb her emotions. This is a reaction she has to the idea of her mother. But she lives in a state of negation of her own reality. She fools hersef to think that this is actually something that makes her free and empowers her, but nevertheless, she still has the same emotional needs for being acepted and experience beauty.
    - Retreats, embraces Alchemy for control and cynicism/drugs as defense mechanisms.
    - Develops cynicism and potentially uses substances (drugs/alchemy-derived) as defense mechanisms against the overwhelming fear, visions, and ambient psychic noise (**Maladaptive Coping Mechanisms**).
    - **(new)** While retreating into Alchemy, a dangerous experiment (perhaps attempting to create a substance to dampen Sight) nearly exposes her illicit activities or harms someone, forcing her to become even more secretive and reinforcing the idea that even her attempts at control are fraught with danger (**Consequences of Seeking Control**).
    - *(Implied: Establishes her pre-story life as an isolated, functional but emotionally guarded alchemist, avoiding the Council and managing her Sight through suppression and chemical aids).*

- **Early Adulthood (Pre-Story):**
    - Establishes a life as an isolated alchemist, avoiding the Council based on fear and fragmentary visions of danger.

    - Elowen travels to Elendora, experiencing the city's oppressive atmosphere.
- **Plot Point 1:**
    - Elowen cautiously searches for and finds Brevin.

- **Resolution:**
    - *(Optional)* Years later, the manuscript is found in a changed, "Seerless" world, leaving Elowen's legacy ambiguous.
